<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA and can move and push text blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The player needs to move the FLAG to the goal to win.

### Objective:
Move BABA to the FLAG to win.

### Analysis:
- **BABA** starts at B2 and needs to reach F13.
- **FLAG** is currently at F13, which is the winning condition.
- **WALL** (W) and **GRASS** (A) are movable objects.
- **LAVA** (L) and **ROCK** (R) are immovable obstacles.
- **KEKE** (K) and **GOOP** (G) are not directly relevant to the solution based on the given rules.

### Plan:
1. **Move the WALL:** Since WALLs are pushable and are in the way, moving them is the first step.
2. **Create a Path:** Use the moved WALLs to create a clear path from BABA to the FLAG.
3. **Move the FLAG:** Once the path is clear, move the FLAG to the winning position.

### Step 2: Implement the Plan

**Step 1: Move the WALLs**

- **Move the WALL at B1 to B2:** This clears the path from BABA to the direction of the FLAG.
- **Move the WALL at B3 to B4:** This creates a path from BABA to the FLAG.

**Step 2: Move the FLAG**

- **Move the FLAG from F13 to B2:** Now that a clear path exists, move the FLAG to B2.

### Intermediate Actions:

- **Move BABA to B1:** Before moving the WALLs, move BABA to B1 to prepare for the next steps.
- **Move WALL at B1 to B2:** After moving BABA to B1, move the WALL at B1 to B2.
- **Move WALL at B3 to B4:** After moving the WALL at B1, move the WALL at B3 to B4.

### Final Configuration:

```
_B12..F13_
_ . . . _ 
_ . . . _ 
_ . . . _ 
_.b....f._
_ . . . _
_ . . . _
_ . . . _
__________
```

**BABA:** B1
**FLAG:** F2 (Moved from F13 to B2)

### Final Answer:
The final answer is BABA at B1 and FLAG at F2. I hope it is correct.

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA and can move and push text blocks.

**Level Layout:**
- **Top Row:** BABA (B) next to a WALL (W), a SKULL (S), and an empty space (.).
- **Middle Row:** An empty space (.), a FLAG (F), and a ROCK (R) with BABA (B) adjacent to it.
- **Bottom Row:** An empty space (.), a LOVE (V), a GOOP (G), and an empty space (.).

**Objective:** The objective is to manipulate the text blocks to form the rule **"BABA IS WIN"** to win the level.

### Step 2: Formulate a Plan

**Objective:** Move the text block "WIN" (3) to a position where it can form the rule "BABA IS WIN" with BABA (B).

**Constraints:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player can move and push text blocks using BABA.
- **WALL:** Blocks cannot be moved through walls.
- **FLAG:** Can be pushed but does not affect the rule formation directly.
- **ROCK:** Can be pushed but does not affect the rule formation directly.
- **SKULL:** Can be pushed but does not affect the rule formation directly.
- **GOOP:** Can be pushed but does not affect the rule formation directly.
- **LOVE:** Can be pushed but does not affect the rule formation directly.
- **V:** Can be pushed but does not affect the rule formation directly.

**Plan:**
1. **Move "WIN" (3) to the bottom row:** Since BABA is at the top row, we need to move "WIN" to the bottom row to form "BABA IS WIN".
2. **Utilize LOVE (V) to push "WIN" (3):** Since BABA cannot move "WIN" directly, we need to use LOVE to push "WIN".

### Step 3: Execute the Plan

**Initial Position:**
```
B _ S . 
. F R B
. . . .
V G .
```

**Step 1:** Move LOVE (V) to push "WIN" (3) down.

- Move LOVE (V) from the bottom row to the middle row, pushing "WIN" (3) down.
```
B _ S . 
. F R B
. . . .
V . G
```

**Step 2:** Move "WIN" (3) to the top row.

- Move "WIN" (3) from the bottom row to the top row.
```
B _ S . 
. F R B
. . . .
. 3 .
```

**Step 3:** Form the rule "BABA IS WIN".

- Move "WIN" (3) horizontally next to BABA (B) to form "BABA IS WIN".
```
B _ S . 
. F R B
. . . .
. 3 B
```

**Solution:**

The final position of the text blocks should look like this:

```
B _ S . 
. F R B
. . . .
. 3 B
```

**Final Rule:** "BABA IS WIN"

### Final Answer

The final answer is: B _ S . F R B . 3 B. I hope it is correct.

- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA and can move and push text blocks.

**Level Layout:**
```
__________
_........_
_...B12.._
_........_
_.1......_
_.3..b..._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________
```

**Current Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA.

### Plan

1. **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to reach the position marked as "WIN" (position 3).
2. **Analyze the Current State:** BABA is currently at position (1,2) and the WIN text block is at position (1,3).
3. **Determine the Required Actions:**
   - Move BABA to position (1,3) to make "BABA IS WIN".
   - Ensure no other rules interfere with this movement.

### Steps to Solve

**Step 1: Move BABA to Position (1,3)**

- **Move BABA right (to position 2,2):** BABA can move right since there are no WALLs (W) in the way.
- **Move BABA down (to position 2,3):** Again, no WALLs in the way.

After these moves, BABA will be at position (2,3), allowing us to align "BABA IS WIN" and win the level.

### Intermediate Actions

1. **Move BABA right (from 1,2 to 2,2):**

```
__________
_........_
_...B12.._
_........_
_.1......_
_.3..b..._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________
```

BABA is now at (2,2).

2. **Move BABA down (from 2,2 to 2,3):**

```
__________
_........_
_...B12.._
_........_
_.1......_
_.3..b..._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________
```

BABA is now at (2,3), completing the alignment "BABA IS WIN".

### Final Answer

The final answer is BABA at (2,3) aligning "BABA IS WIN". I hope it is correct.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to the goal position to win.

**Rules Explanation:**
- **`<object_text> IS <property_text>`:** Grants a property to an object.
  - **`BABA IS YOU`** means you control BABA and can move it.
  - **`FLAG IS WIN`** means you need to move the FLAG to the goal position to win.

**Special Properties:**
- **`HOT`:** Destroys objects marked as MELT when they touch.
- **`MELT`:** Makes an object disappear when touched by something HOT.
- **`STOP`:** Makes an object impassable.
- **`PUSH`:** Allows an object to push other objects.
- **`KILL`:** Destroys anything you control when it touches another object.
- **`SINK`:** Makes an object and anything it touches disappear.

### Step 2: Analyze the Level

**Initial Position:**
```
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._
_........_
_......1F_
```

**Objective:**
Move BABA to the position where the FLAG is (F13) and then move the FLAG to the goal position (1F).

### Step 3: Plan the Solution

**Initial Observations:**
- **BABA** starts at B12.
- **FLAG** is at F13.
- **Goal Position** is 1F.

**Required Moves:**
1. Move BABA from B12 to F13.
2. Move FLAG from F13 to 1F.

**Constraints:**
- **BABA** can push blocks.
- **FLAG** is the target to win.
- **WALL** and **ROCK** are immovable.
- **KEKE** and **GOOP** are not initially in play.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan

**Move 1: Move BABA to F13**

- **BABA** can push the **ROCK** at B12 to the right (R12).
- After pushing the **ROCK**, **BABA** can move to the empty space (B11).

```
_B1..R12_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._
_........_
_......1F_
```

**Move 2: Move FLAG to 1F**

- **BABA** can push the **WALL** at F12 to the right (F11).
- **BABA** can then move to F12.
- **BABA** can push the **FLAG** at F13 to the empty space (F12).

```
_B1..R12_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R....F12
_........_
_......1F_
```

**Final Position:**
```
_B1..R12_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R....F12
_........_
_......1F_
```

**Conclusion:**

BABA has moved to F12 and the FLAG has been moved to 1F, achieving the goal. 

Final Answer: The final answer is _B1..R12_ _........_ _........_ .b....r. _........_ _...R....F12 _........_ _......1F_. I hope it is correct.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_.R1R...._
_........_
_.....R1F_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, ROCK IS ROCK and ROCK IS FLAG.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to the WIN position to win.
- **ROCK IS ROCK:** Rocks are just rocks, no special properties.
- **ROCK IS FLAG:** This rule doesn't seem to be active or correctly placed since it implies rocks can turn into flags, which contradicts the standard rules provided. Assuming it was a typo and should be ignored for now.

### Rule Explanation:
- **IS YOU:** Controls the movement and actions of BABA.
- **IS WIN:** Determines the object that, when moved to a specific location (WIN position), wins the level.
- **IS STOP:** Makes an object impassable.
- **IS MELT:** Makes an object destructible by HOT objects.
- **IS HOT:** Allows an object to destroy MELT objects.
- **IS MOVE:** Makes an object move automatically each turn.
- **IS KILL:** Makes an object destroy other controlled objects upon contact.
- **IS PUSH:** Allows an object to be pushed or to push other objects.
- **IS SINK:** Destroys an object and anything it touches upon contact.

### Level Analysis:
- **Initial Position:** BABA starts at B2, FLAG is at F13, and there's a ROCK at R1.
- **Objective:** Move the FLAG to the WIN position (presumably F1 based on typical grid layout).

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA:** Use BABA to move objects and clear a path to the FLAG.
2. **Move FLAG:** Use BABA to move the FLAG to the WIN position.
3. **Ensure WIN Condition:** Ensure the FLAG is in the correct position to win.

### Step 2: Implement the Plan

**Step 1: Move BABA**

- **Move Right:** BABA can move right to B1, pushing the ROCK at R1 to R2.
- **Move Down:** BABA moves down to B2, pushing the WALL at B1 to B1.

**Step 2: Move FLAG**

- **Move Left:** Move BABA left to B1.
- **Move Down:** Move BABA down to F11, pushing the WALL at F12 to F12.
- **Move Right:** Move BABA right to F13, pushing the FLAG at F13 to F14.

**Step 3: Check WIN Condition**

- **Position Check:** The FLAG is now at F14, which is not the WIN position (assuming WIN position is F1 based on typical grid layout).

### Correction Needed:
- **Reassess WIN Position:** If the WIN position is F1, we need to adjust our moves accordingly.

### Adjusted Plan:

**Step 1: Move BABA**

- **Move Right:** BABA moves to B2, pushing the ROCK at R1 to R2.
- **Move Down:** BABA moves down to B2.

**Step 2: Move FLAG**

- **Move Left:** Move BABA left to B1.
- **Move Down:** Move BABA down to F11, pushing the WALL at F12 to F12.
- **Move Right:** Move BABA right to F13, pushing the FLAG at F13 to F14.

**Step 3: Correct FLAG Position**

- **Move FLAG:** Move BABA to F1 (using a series of moves to navigate through the grid), then move the FLAG to F1.

### Final Solution:

**Intermediate Grid:**

```
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_.R1R...._
_........_
_.....R1F_
__________
```

**Final Position:**

```
_F1..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_.R1R...._
_........_
_.....R1F_
```

**Final Answer:** The final answer is the FLAG is moved to F1. I hope it is correct.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_K......._
_1k.B..12_
_7......._

_..b.f..._
_........_
_........_
_.....F13_
__________
current active rules are: KEKE IS MOVE and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (Object b)
- SKULL (Object s)
- FLAG (Object f)
- FLOOR (Object o)
- GRASS (Object a)
- LAVA (Object l)
- ROCK (Object r)
- WALL (Object w)
- KEKE (Object k)
- GOOP (Object g)
- LOVE (Object v)
- _ (Border, does nothing)
- . (Empty space)

**Text Blocks:**
- **KEKE IS MOVE:** Any KEKE can move one step in its direction every turn.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** To win the level, you need to move the FLAG (Object f) to a winning position.

**Rules:**
- **Object Text IS Property Text:** 
  - **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA.
  - **FLAG IS WIN:** The level is won by moving the FLAG (Object f) to a winning position.
  - **KEKE IS MOVE:** Any KEKE can move one step in its direction every turn.

**Level Layout:**
```
_ K . _ 
_ 1k.B 12_
_ 7 . _ 
_ . . _ 
_ . b . f_ 
_ . . _ 
_ . . _ 
_ . F13_
```

### Analysis:
- **KEKE:** Can move one step in its direction.
- **FLAG:** Must be moved to position **13** to win.
- **BABA:** You control BABA and can push blocks.
- **GOOP:** Does not affect gameplay directly.
- **LAVA:** Does not affect gameplay directly.
- **ROCK:** Does not affect gameplay directly.
- **WALL:** Does not affect gameplay directly.
- **SKULL:** Does not affect gameplay directly.
- **GRASS:** Does not affect gameplay directly.
- **LOVE:** Does not affect gameplay directly.

### Plan:
1. **Move KEKE:** Use KEKE to clear a path towards the FLAG.
2. **Move FLAG:** Push the FLAG to position **13**.
3. **Win:** Position the FLAG in **13**.

### Intermediate Actions:
1. **Move KEKE:** Since KEKE can move, let's move it to clear a path towards the FLAG.
2. **Clear Path:** Move KEKE to push the WALL blocking the path to the FLAG.

### Solution Steps:
1. **Move KEKE:** Move KEKE right (from _ K . _ to _ 1k.B 12_).
2. **Push WALL:** Use KEKE to push the WALL (W) to the right (from _ 1k.B 12_ to _ 1k.B _).
3. **Move KEKE:** Move KEKE up (from _ 1k.B _ to _ . _).
4. **Move FLAG:** Move BABA to push the GOOP (G) out of the way (from _ . b . f_ to _ . _).
5. **Move FLAG:** Move FLAG up (from _ . _ to _ F13_).

### Final Answer:
```
_ K . _ 
_ 1k.B 12_
_ 7 . _ 
_ . . _ 
_ . b . f_ 
_ . . _ 
_ . . _ 
_ . F13_
```

The FLAG is now in position **13**, so you have won the level.

Final Answer: The final answer is moving KEKE to clear a path, then moving FLAG to position **13**. I hope it is correct.

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to the WIN position (13th cell).
- **WALL IS STOP:** Walls are impassable.

### Objective:
Move BABA to the WIN position (13th cell) while pushing the FLAG into position.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Position:**
   - BABA starts at (12, 1)
   - FLAG starts at (1, 1)
   - WIN position is at (13, 1)

2. **Constraints:**
   - **WALL IS STOP:** Walls are impassable.
   - **WALL IS HOT:** Walls destroy anything marked as MELT when they touch it. Since WALL is HOT and FLAG is marked as MELT, moving FLAG over a WALL will destroy FLAG.
   - **WALL IS KILL:** WALL destroys anything you control (BABA) when BABA touches it.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA around without touching WALLs.**
2. **Push the FLAG towards the WIN position without touching WALLs.**
3. **Ensure FLAG does not get destroyed by WALLs.**

### Step 2: Implement the Plan

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_........_
_S14....._
_....sss._
_.b..sfs._
_....sss._
_........_
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and SKULL IS KILL.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to win.
- **SKULL IS KILL:** SKULL destroys anything it touches, including BABA.

**Level Layout:**
```
_ . S1 ._
_ . s s ._
_ . b s f ._
_ . s s ._
_ . _ _ _
_B . F . 13_
```

### Analysis:
- **Objective:** Move BABA to the FLAG (F) to win.
- **Constraints:** BABA can be killed by SKULL (S). SKULL moves horizontally.
- **Initial Position:** BABA starts at B12, SKULL at S14.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA away from SKULL:** To avoid immediate death, move BABA horizontally away from SKULL.
2. **Move BABA towards FLAG:** Once safe, move BABA towards the FLAG.
3. **Utilize other objects:** Use GOOP (G) and LOVE (V) if necessary to block SKULL or create paths.

### Step 2: Execute the Plan

**Step 1: Move BABA away from SKULL**

- Move BABA from B12 to B11:
  ```
  _ . S1 ._
  _ . s s ._
  _ . b s f ._
  _ . s s ._
  _ . _ _ _
  _ . . . 11_
  _ . F . 13_
  ```

**Step 2: Move BABA towards FLAG**

- Move BABA from B11 to B10:
  ```
  _ . S1 ._
  _ . s s ._
  _ . b s f ._
  _ . s s ._
  _ . _ _ _
  _ . . . 10_
  _ . F . 13_
  ```

**Step 3: Block SKULL**

- Move GOOP (G) from its initial position to block SKULL:
  ```
  _ . S1 ._
  _ . g . s_
  _ . b s f ._
  _ . g . s_
  _ . s s ._
  _ . _ _ _
  _ . . . 10_
  _ . F . 13_
  ```

**Step 4: Move BABA closer to FLAG**

- Move BABA from B10 to B9:
  ```
  _ . S1 ._
  _ . g . s_
  _ . b s f ._
  _ . g . s_
  _ . s s ._
  _ . _ _ _
  _ . . . 9_
  _ . F . 13_
  ```

**Step 5: Ensure BABA reaches FLAG**

- Move BABA from B9 to F13 (FLAG is at F13):
  ```
  _ . S1 ._
  _ . g . s_
  _ . b s f ._
  _ . g . s_
  _ . s s ._
  _ . _ _ _
  _ . . . 9_
  _ . F . 13_
  ```

### Final Answer:
The final answer is BABA at F13 (FLAG). I hope it is correct.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- GOOP (G)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- LOVE (V)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to win.
- **GOOP IS SINK:** GOOP sinks and destroys anything it touches.

**Level Layout:**
```
B _ B _ G G _ F . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G
  S       1   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
  G       8   0   2   6   7   9   5   1
  G G G   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
  G G G   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  G . .   .   .   .   .   .   .   G10
  . G .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ggg
  . . V   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
```

### Rule Explanation:
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG (F) to the goal position (indicated by "WIN" somewhere in the grid).
- **GOOP IS SINK:** GOOP sinks and destroys anything it touches.

### Plan:
1. **Identify the Goal:** Move the FLAG (F) to the WIN position.
2. **Utilize GOOP:** Since GOOP sinks anything it touches, we can use it to clear obstacles or reach otherwise inaccessible positions.
3. **Move BABA:** Use BABA to push blocks and manipulate the grid to reach the FLAG.

### Intermediate Actions:
1. **Move GOOP:** Since GOOP sinks, we should first move GOOP to clear a path or reach a strategic position.
2. **Position BABA:** Use BABA to push blocks and create a path to the FLAG.

Let's start implementing these steps:

#### Step 1: Move GOOP
- Move GOOP (G) to the top-left corner (position B1) to start clearing paths.

```
B _ G _ G _ F . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G
  S       1   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
  G       8   0   2   6   7   9   5   1
  G G G   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
  G G G   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  G . .   .   .   .   .   .   .   G10
  . G .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ggg
  . . V   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
```

#### Step 2: Move GOOP to clear a path
- Move GOOP (G) right to position B2.

```
B _ G _ G _ F . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G
  S       1   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
  G       8   0   2   6   7   9   5   1
  G G G   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
  G G G   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  G . .   .   .   .   .   .   .   G10
  . G .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ggg
  . . V   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
```

#### Step 3: Move BABA to clear more paths
- Move BABA (B) right to position B2 to push GOOP (G) further.

```
B _ G _ G _ F . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G
  S       1   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
  G       8   0   2   6   7   9   5   1
  G G G   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
  G G G   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  G . .   .   .   .   .   .   .   G10
  . G .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ggg
  . . V   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
```

#### Step 4: Move GOOP to clear a path towards FLAG
- Move GOOP (G) down to position B3.

```
B _ G _ G _ F . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G
  S       1   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
  G       8   0   2   6   7   9   5   1
  G G G   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
  G G G   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  G . .   .   .   .   .   .   .   G10
  . G .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ggg
  . . V   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
```

#### Step 5: Move BABA to push the FLAG
- Move BABA (B) down to position B3 to push the FLAG (F) towards the WIN position.

```
B _ G _ G _ F . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G
  S       1   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
  G       8   0   2   6   7   9   5   1
  G G G   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
  G G G   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  G . .   .   .   .   .   .   .   G10
  . G .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ggg
  . . V   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
```

#### Step 6: Move FLAG to WIN position
- Move the FLAG (F) to position G10.

```
B _ G _ G _ F . _ G . _ G . _ G . _ G
  S       1   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
  G       8   0   2   6   7   9   5   1
  G G G   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
  G G G   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  G . .   .   .   .   .   .   .   G10
  . G .   .   .   .   .   .   .   ggg
  . . V   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
```

### Final Answer:
The final answer is moving the FLAG (F) to position G10. I hope it is correct.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, GOOP IS SINK and ROCK IS PUSH.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- GOOP (G)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- LOVE (V)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
1. **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
2. **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to win.
3. **GOOP IS SINK:** GOOP sinks when touching any SINK (not explicitly marked but implied by the rule).
4. **ROCK IS PUSH:** ROCK can be pushed and pushes other objects.

### Analysis:
- **Goal:** Move BABA to the FLAG to win.
- **Obstacles:** GOOP is initially in the way and will sink if it touches any SINK.
- **Tools:** BABA can push ROCKS and WALLS.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA:** Start by moving BABA to clear a path.
2. **Clear Path:** Move WALLS and ROCKS to create a clear path to the FLAG.
3. **Handle GOOP:** Move GOOP away from potential SINKs.
4. **Reach FLAG:** Use BABA to push the FLAG into a winning position.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,

    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:

    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, LAVA IS HOT and BABA IS MELT.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
1. **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
2. **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to reach the FLAG to win.
3. **LAVA IS HOT:** LAVA destroys any object marked as MELT when they touch.
4. **BABA IS MELT:** BABA melts when touching LAVA or any object marked as HOT.

**Level Layout:**
```
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B._
_1...b.1._
_8.....9._
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
```

### Analysis:
- **Objective:** Move BABA to the FLAG (F) to win.
- **Constraints:**
  - **BABA IS MELT:** BABA will melt if it touches LAVA (L) or any object marked as HOT.
  - **LAVA IS HOT:** LAVA destroys objects marked as MELT.
  - **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can push blocks.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA away from LAVA:** To avoid immediate destruction.
2. **Move BABA towards the FLAG:** Utilize pushing capabilities to move blocks if necessary.
3. **Clear a path:** Remove any obstacles between BABA and the FLAG.

### Step 2: Execute the Plan

**Step 1: Move BABA away from LAVA**

BABA can move right (since there are no obstacles in that direction):

```
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B._
_1...b.1._
_8.....9._
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
BABA -> _ (empty space)
```

**Step 2: Move BABA towards the FLAG**

BABA needs to move to the space where the FLAG (F) is located. To get there, BABA can push the ROCK (R) to the left:

```
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B.
_1...b.1._
_8.....9.
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
BABA -> _ (empty space) -> _ (push ROCK)
```

**Step 3: Clear a path**

BABA needs to move the WALL (W) in front of the FLAG to reach it:

```
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B.
_1...b.1.
_8.....9.
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
```

BABA can push the WALL (W) down:

```
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B.
_1...b.1.
_8.....9.
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
WALL -> _ (empty space)
```

Now, BABA can move to the FLAG:

```
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B.
_1...b.1.
_8.....9.
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
BABA -> F (FLAG)
```

### Final Answer:
The final answer is BABA reaching the FLAG. I hope it is correct.

_2..F13.._
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and LAVA IS STOP.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to the WIN position to win.
- **LAVA IS STOP:** LAVA blocks movement; you cannot move through LAVA.

### Objective:
Move BABA to the WIN position (FLAG) while respecting the rules and constraints.

### Observations:
1. **Starting Position:**
   - BABA starts at (0, 0).
   - FLAG is at (13, 3).
   - LAVA blocks movement in certain areas.

2. **Rules Impact:**
   - **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can push blocks.
   - **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to (13, 3).
   - **LAVA IS STOP:** LAVA blocks movement; BABA cannot move through LAVA.

### Plan:
1. **Identify the Path:** Find a path from BABA to FLAG that avoids LAVA.
2. **Move BABA:** Use pushes to move BABA along the path.
3. **Manipulate Blocks:** If necessary, push blocks to create a clear path or to reach the FLAG.

### Step 2: Implement the Plan

**Step 1: Identify the Path**
- **Path:** BABA needs to move from (0, 0) to (13, 3) avoiding LAVA.
- **Possible Path:** Move BABA right (to avoid LAVA at (1, 0)), then up (to avoid LAVA at (1, 1)), then left (to avoid LAVA at (2, 2)), and finally up to (13, 3).
