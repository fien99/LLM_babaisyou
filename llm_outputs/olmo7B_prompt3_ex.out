<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,

    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________

_........_
_........_
_........_
_.b....f._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B) - Player-controlled object
- FLAG (F) - Object that needs to be reached to win
- _ (border) - Unmovable object
- . (empty space) - Placeholder

**Text Blocks:**
- BABA IS YOU: The player controls BABA.
- FLAG IS WIN: To win, the player must move BABA to the FLAG.

**Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The objective is to move BABA to the FLAG to win.

### Plan

1. **Identify the Goal:** Move BABA to the FLAG (F13).
2. **Current Obstacles:** BABA starts at B12, and there are walls (W) and empty spaces (.) blocking the path.
3. **Possible Actions:**
   - **Move:** BABA can move horizontally or vertically.
   - **Push:** BABA can push objects or text blocks.
   - **Create/Remove Rules:** Use text blocks to form or remove rules.

### Intermediate Actions

**Step 1:** Move BABA to the first empty space (B12 -> B11).

**Step 2:** Push the GOOP (G) to clear a path towards FLAG.

**Step 3:** Move BABA to the next empty space (B11 -> B10).

**Step 4:** Push the SKULL (s) to create a path towards FLAG.

**Step 5:** Move BABA to the final empty space (B10 -> F13).

**Step 6:** Push the LOVE (V) to clear any remaining obstacles.

### Solution Steps

**Step 1: Move BABA to B11**

- **Action:** Move BABA from B12 to B11.
  - **Result:** BABA is now at B11.

**Step 2: Push GOOP to clear path**

- **Action:** BABA pushes GOOP from B12 to an empty space.
  - **Result:** GOOP is moved, clearing a path towards F13.

**Step 3: Move BABA to B10**

- **Action:** Move BABA from B11 to B10.
  - **Result:** BABA is now at B10.

**Step 4: Push SKULL to clear path**

- **Action:** BABA pushes SKULL from B10 to an empty space.
  - **Result:** SKULL is moved, creating a path towards F13.

**Step 5: Move BABA to F13**

- **Action:** Move BABA from B10 to F13.
  - **Result:** BABA reaches FLAG (F13), winning the level.

**Step 6: Push LOVE to clear final obstacle**

- **Action:** BABA pushes LOVE from F13 to an empty space.
  - **Result:** LOVE is moved, ensuring no obstacles remain.

### Final Answer

The final answer is: Move BABA from B12 to B11, push GOOP to clear a path, move BABA to B10, push SKULL to create a path, move BABA to F13, and push LOVE to clear the final obstacle. I hope it is correct.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12...13_
_........_
_........_
_.....F.._
_.b....f._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B) - Player-controlled object
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Text Blocks:**
- BABA (object baba)
- YOU (2)
- WIN (3)
- STOP (6)
- HOT (8)
- MELT (9)
- MOVE (7)
- KILL (4)
- PUSH (5)
- IS (1)

**Current Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA. This rule is active and allows the player to move BABA and interact with other objects using BABA's properties.

### Analysis:
- **Objective:** The goal is to win the level, which means reaching the object marked as "WIN" (F).
- **Constraints:** BABA can interact with objects and text blocks to change rules, move objects, or create new rules.
- **Available Actions:** Move, Push, Brake Rule, Make Rule.

### Plan:
1. **Identify Key Objectives:**
   - Move BABA to the WIN (F).
   - Create or modify rules to facilitate reaching the WIN.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - BABA is currently next to a WALL (W) and a KEKE (K). 
   - There's a FLAG (F) adjacent to BABA.

3. **Possible Actions:**
   - **Move:** Move BABA towards the WIN.
   - **Push:** Push KEKE or WALL to create paths.
   - **Make Rule:** Create a rule to make BABA move automatically or change the game state.

### Step 2: Implement the Plan

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move BABA towards WIN:**
   - Move BABA right (to position B2) and then down (to position B3).

2. **Utilize KEKE:**
   - Push KEKE (K) to position K2. This might create a path for BABA to reach the WIN.

3. **Create a Rule for Automatic Movement:**
   - Move the text block "MOVE" (7) next to BABA (to position B2).
   - Use the text block "YOU" (2) to create the rule: **BABA IS MOVE**. This will make BABA move automatically in its current direction every turn.

**Actions:**

- **Move:** BABA -> B2
- **Push:** K -> K2

**After these actions:**

- BABA is at B2.
- KEKE is at K2.
- The rule **BABA IS MOVE** is created, making BABA move right every turn.

**Next Steps:**

- **Move:** BABA -> B3 (automatically due to the rule)
- **Move:** BABA -> F (automatically due to the rule)

**Final Position:** BABA will end up at F3 after a few turns due to the "MOVE" rule.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is BABA at F3. I hope it is correct.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Text Blocks:**
- **Object Text:** BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, LAVA, ROCK, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE
- **Property Text:** 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 4 (KILL), 5 (PUSH), 6 (STOP), 7 (MOVE), 8 (HOT), 9 (MELT), 0 (SINK)

**Current Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA. This means BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with other objects and rules.

### Analysis:
- **Objective:** The goal is to manipulate the text blocks to form the rule **"BABA IS WIN"**. This means BABA needs to reach the position where "WIN" is located to win the level.
- **Constraints:** BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with rules. The rule "BABA IS YOU" allows BABA to perform these actions.
- **Obstacles:** BABA can be stopped by walls (W), lava (L), and other objects. The rule "STOP" can be used to immobilize objects temporarily.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA towards the WIN position:** BABA needs to navigate through the grid, avoiding obstacles and using the "PUSH" action to rearrange text blocks if necessary.
2. **Create the rule "BABA IS WIN":** BABA needs to align the text blocks "BABA" and "WIN" in a valid rule format (either horizontally or vertically).

### Intermediate Actions:

**Step 1:** Move BABA towards the top-left corner.

**Step 2:** Push the "1" (which represents "1 IS") block to the right to create space.

**Step 3:** Move BABA to the position where "WIN" is located.

**Step 4:** Push the "WIN" block to align with "BABA".

**Step 5:** Ensure no other blocks interfere with the rule formation.

### Solution:

**Initial Grid:**

```
_........_
_...B12.._
_........_

B A W  ._
_........_
_........_
_........_
```

**Active Rules:**

- **BABA IS YOU:** Still active, allowing BABA to move and interact.
- **BABA IS WIN:** Formed by aligning "BABA" and "WIN".

**Solution:** BABA has successfully aligned the "BABA" and "WIN" text blocks to form the rule "BABA IS WIN", allowing BABA to win the level.

[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._
_........_
_......1F_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- FLAG (F)
- SKULL (S)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- GRASS (A)
- LOVE (V)
- GOOP (G)
- Empty spaces (_)

**Text Blocks:**
- BABA (B)
- FLAG (F)
- YOU (2)
- WIN (3)
- STOP (6)
- MOVE (7)
- HOT (8)
- MELT (9)
- IS (1)

**Current Active Rules:**
1. **BABA IS YOU**: The player controls BABA. This means BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with other objects.
2. **FLAG IS WIN**: To win the level, the player must move BABA to the FLAG.

**Level Layout:**
- **Start:** BABA is at position (0,0) (top-left corner).
- **Goal:** FLAG is at position (1,1) (top-right corner).
- **Obstacles:** WALLs (W), LAVA (L), GRASS (A), and other objects.

**Rules to Consider:**
- **BABA IS YOU**: BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with objects.
- **FLAG IS WIN**: BABA needs to reach FLAG to win.
- **STOP**: Makes an object impassable.
- **HOT & MELT**: Objects marked HOT destroy objects marked MELT on contact.
- **MOVE**: BABA moves one step in its current direction every turn.
- **KILL**: BABA destroys any other controlled objects on contact.
- **IS**: Creates rules based on alignment.

### Plan

1. **Move BABA towards the FLAG**: BABA needs to reach FLAG (F) to win.
2. **Manipulate Rules**: Use available text blocks to create rules that aid in reaching the FLAG.
3. **Avoid KILL and MELT**: Ensure BABA doesn’t destroy itself or other objects unnecessarily.

### Intermediate Actions

**Step 1:** Move BABA towards the FLAG.

- Move BABA right (R) from (0,0) to (0,1).

**Step 2:** Create a rule to make the path clearer or to remove an obstacle.

- **Objective:** Use available text blocks to create a rule that allows BABA to pass through or destroy obstacles.
- **Available Text Blocks:** B, F, 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 6 (STOP), 7 (MOVE), 8 (HOT), 9 (MELT).

**Step 3:** Ensure BABA doesn’t encounter HOT or MELT.

- **Check:** Ensure no HOT blocks are in BABA’s path.
- **Manipulate:** If necessary, use IS STOP or IS MOVE to control the movement of other objects or create paths.

**Step 4:** Continue moving BABA towards FLAG.

- **Move BABA down (D) from (0,1) to (0,2)**.

**Step 5:** Create a rule to remove or bypass obstacles.

- **Objective:** Use text blocks to create a rule that allows BABA to pass through or destroy obstacles.
- **Available Text Blocks:** B, F, 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 6 (STOP), 7 (MOVE), 8 (HOT), 9 (MELT).

**Step 6:** Ensure BABA doesn’t encounter HOT or MELT.

- **Check:** Ensure no HOT blocks are in BABA’s path.
- **Manipulate:** If necessary, use IS STOP or IS MOVE to control the movement of other objects or create paths.

**Step 7:** Continue moving BABA towards FLAG.

- **Move BABA down (D) from (0,2) to (0,3)**.

**Step 8:** Final Approach to FLAG.

- **Move BABA right (R) from (0,3) to (1,3)**.

**Step 9:** Win the Level.

- **Position:** BABA is now at (1,3), next to the FLAG (F).

**Solution Summary:**

1. **Move BABA right (R) from (0,0) to (0,1)**.
2. **Move BABA down (D) from (0,1) to (0,2)**.
3. **Move BABA down (D) from (0,2) to (0,3)**.
4. **Move BABA right (R) from (0,3) to (1,3)**.
5. **Position:** BABA at (1,3) next to FLAG (F).

**Final Answer:** The final answer is BABA at (1,3) next to FLAG (F). I hope it is correct.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_.R1R...._
_........_
_.....R1F_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, ROCK IS ROCK and ROCK IS FLAG.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- FLAG (F)
- ROCK (R)
- SKULL (s)
- GRASS (a)
- LOVE (v)
- GOOP (g)
- WALL (w)

**Text Blocks:**
- BABA IS YOU (B)
- FLAG IS WIN (F)
- ROCK IS ROCK (R)
- ROCK IS FLAG (R)

**Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA and can move and interact with the grid.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The player needs to move the FLAG to the goal area to win.
- **ROCK IS ROCK:** All ROCKs are initially indistinguishable and behave as ROCKs.
- **ROCK IS FLAG:** This rule transforms ROCKs into FLAGs when aligned correctly.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Setup:** BABA starts at B12, FLAG is at F13, and ROCKs are scattered with one at R1 and another forming part of the wall at R1R.
- **Objective:** Move the FLAG to a winning position (e.g., to F1R1) while ensuring that ROCKs are correctly transformed into FLAGs to facilitate movement.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA:** Use BABA to rearrange the ROCKs and create paths.
2. **Transform ROCKs:** Use BABA to align ROCKs with the "ROCK IS FLAG" rule to turn them into FLAGs.
3. **Move FLAG:** Use the newly transformed FLAGs to move the actual FLAG to the goal.

### Intermediate Actions:

#### Step 1.1: Move BABA to Rearrange ROCKs
- **Objective:** Move BABA to a position where it can interact with the ROCKs to form "ROCK IS FLAG" alignments.

#### Step 1.2: Transform ROCKs into FLAGs
- **Objective:** Use BABA to align ROCKs with the "ROCK IS FLAG" rule.

#### Step 1.3: Move FLAG to Goal
- **Objective:** Use the newly transformed FLAGs to move the actual FLAG to the goal area.

### Solution Execution:

#### Step 1.1: Move BABA to Rearrange ROCKs
- **Action:** BABA moves to B11.
- **Grid Update:**
  ```
  _B1..F1_
  _........_
  _........_
  _b....r. _
  _........_
  _R1R...._
  _........_
  _.....R1F_
  ```

#### Step 1.2: Transform ROCKs into FLAGs
- **Action:** BABA pushes the ROCK at R1 to the left, aligning it with the "ROCK IS FLAG" rule.
- **Grid Update:**
  ```
  _B1..F1_
  _........_
  _........_
  _b....r. _
  _R1F      _
  _........_
  _R1R...._
  _........_
  _.....R1F_
  ```

- **Result:** The ROCK at R1 is now a FLAG.

#### Step 1.3: Move FLAG to Goal
- **Action:** Use the newly transformed FLAG at R1 to move the actual FLAG at F13 to F1R1.
- **Grid Update:**
  ```
  _B1..F1_
  _........_
  _........_
  _b....r. _
  _F1R1    _
  _........_
  _R1R...._
  _........_
  _.....R1F_
  ```

**Final Answer:** The final answer is B1..F1, F1R1. I hope it is correct.

__________
_K......._
_1k.B..12_
_7......._
_........_
_..b.f..._
_........_
_........_
_.....F13_

current active rules are: KEKE IS MOVE and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (Object b)
- SKULL (Object s)
- FLAG (Object f)
- FLOOR (Object o)
- GRASS (Object a)
- LAVA (Object l)
- ROCK (Object r)
- WALL (Object w)
- KEKE (Object k)
- GOOP (Object g)
- LOVE (Object v)
- _ (Border)
- . (Empty space)

**Text Blocks:**
- **KEKE IS MOVE:** This rule makes KEKE move one step in its current direction every turn.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** This rule indicates that reaching or becoming the FLAG object will win the level.

**Rules:**
- **KEKE IS MOVE:** Automatically moves KEKE each turn.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The objective is to move the BABA (Object b) to the FLAG (Object f) to win.

### Plan

1. **Move KEKE:** Since KEKE is already moving, we need to guide it to a position where it can interact with BABA.
2. **Manipulate BABA:** We need to move BABA towards the FLAG.
3. **Remove Obstacles:** Ensure there are no walls (WALL, Object w) blocking the path between BABA and FLAG.
4. **Ensure WIN Condition:** Once BABA reaches FLAG, the level is won.

### Intermediate Actions

**Step 1:** Move KEKE

KEKE is already moving, so we don't need to take any action for it yet. It will move one step in its current direction.

**Step 2:** Move BABA

BABA needs to be moved towards the FLAG. Currently, BABA is next to a WALL (w) and a GOOP (g). We need to move BABA to the right (towards the FLAG).

**Step 3:** Remove Obstacles

There are no WALLs directly in the path between BABA and FLAG. However, BABA needs to move past GOOP (g) and KEKE (k).

**Step 4:** Ensure WIN Condition

Once BABA reaches FLAG, the level is won.

### Solution Steps

**Step 1:** Move BABA Right

BABA needs to move right. Since there's a GOOP (g) in the way, we need to move GOOP first.

**Step 2:** Move GOOP

BABA can push GOOP (g) to the right. After BABA pushes GOOP, GOOP will move one step to the right, clearing the path for BABA.

**Step 3:** BABA Reaches FLAG

After BABA pushes GOOP, it will be in a position to move towards the FLAG. Since KEKE is moving, it might interfere, but since KEKE moves in a straight line, it won't block BABA's path directly.

**Solution:**

1. **Move BABA right:** BABA pushes GOOP (g) to the right.
2. **GOOP moves:** GOOP (g) moves one step to the right, clearing the path for BABA.
3. **BABA reaches FLAG:** BABA moves towards the FLAG, winning the level.

**Grid Update:**

```
__________
_k . _        _1k.B..12_
_  k . 7      _        _
_  1k . 12   _        _
_ . . 7      _        _
_ . . .      _        _
_ . . .      _        _
_ . . F13    _        _
__________
```

**Final Answer:** The final answer is BABA pushes GOOP (g) to the right, GOOP moves, and BABA reaches FLAG to win the level. I hope it is correct.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and WALL IS STOP.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- FLAG (F)
- WALL (W)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- SKULL (s)
- FLOOR (o)
- GRASS (a)
- LAVA (l)
- ROCK (r)
- KEKE (k)
- Empty (.)

**Text Blocks:**
- **Object Text:** BABA, FLAG, WALL, GOOP, LOVE, SKULL, FLOOR, GRASS, LAVA, ROCK, KEKE, (Empty)
- **Property Text:** 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 4 (KILL), 5 (PUSH), 6 (STOP), 7 (MOVE), 8 (HOT), 9 (MELT), 0 (SINK)

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA. This means BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with other objects.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The player needs to move BABA to the FLAG to win.
- **WALL IS STOP:** Walls are impassable. BABA cannot move through walls.

### Plan

**Objective:** Move BABA to the FLAG to win.

**Constraints:**
- BABA cannot move through walls.
- BABA can push GOOP (G) and GOOP can potentially move other objects.
- Use the "STOP" property to block paths temporarily.

**Strategy:**
1. **Move BABA towards the FLAG:** Since BABA cannot move through walls, we need to push GOOP to create a path.
2. **Utilize GOOP:** Push GOOP to potentially move other objects or create a path to the FLAG.
3. **Block Paths:** Use WALLs and other objects to block paths temporarily to control the movement of other objects.

### Intermediate Actions

**Step 1:** Move BABA towards the top-left corner.

**Step 2:** Push GOOP down.

**Step 3:** Use GOOP to move other objects or create a path.

**Step 4:** Block paths using WALLs and other objects.

**Step 5:** Move BABA towards the FLAG.

### Solution

**Initial Configuration:**

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_........_
_S14....._
_....sss._
_.b..sfs._
_....sss._
_........_
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and SKULL IS KILL.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- FLAG (F)
- SKULL (S)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- GRASS (A)
- FLOOR (O)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- Empty spaces (_)

**Text Blocks:**
- Object Text: BABA, FLAG, SKULL, GOOP, LOVE, GRASS, FLOOR, LAVA, ROCK, WALL, KEKE, LOVE
- Property Text: IS, YOU, WIN, KILL, PUSH, STOP, MOVE, HOT, MELT, SINK

**Current Active Rules:**
1. **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA. This means BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with other objects.
2. **FLAG IS WIN:** The player needs to reach or make the FLAG object win the level.
3. **SKULL IS KILL:** SKULL destroys any player-controlled object it touches.

### Analysis:
- **Objective:** Move BABA to the FLAG to win.
- **Constraints:** BABA can be killed by SKULL.
- **Initial Position:** BABA starts at B1.
- **FLAG:** Located at F13.
- **SKULL:** Starts at S14.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA away from SKULL:** To avoid immediate death, move BABA away from SKULL.
2. **Create a path to FLAG:** Use the environment to create a path to FLAG.
3. **Utilize GOOP:** GOOP can be used to block SKULL or create a bridge.

### Intermediate Actions:

**Step 1:** Move BABA away from SKULL.

- **Action:** BABA -> B2 (Move to the empty space next to B1)
  
**Step 2:** Create a path to FLAG.

- **Action:** Move GOOP (G) from its initial position to block SKULL's path towards BABA.
  - **Move:** G from S14 -> _14 (Move GOOP to the empty space next to SKULL)
  
**Step 3:** Use GOOP to create a bridge or block SKULL.

- **Action:** Move GOOP (G) to create a bridge or block SKULL.
  - **Move:** G -> F14 (Move GOOP to the empty space next to FLAG)
  - **Result:** GOOP blocks SKULL and creates a path to FLAG for BABA.

**Step 4:** Move BABA towards FLAG.

- **Action:** BABA -> F13 (Move BABA to the FLAG)
  
**Step 5:** Ensure BABA reaches FLAG safely.

- **Action:** If necessary, adjust GOOP to fully block SKULL and secure BABA's path.

**Final Action:** BABA reaches FLAG at F13, winning the level.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is BABA moves to F13, winning the level. I hope it is correct.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12gg..._
_F13gg.f._
_gbggg..._
_g.gggggg_
_g.gggggg_
_g.gg...._
_g....G10_
_gggg...._
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and GOOP IS SINK.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- GOOP (G)
- FLAG (F)
- SKULL (S)
- GRASS (A)
- LOVE (V)
- FLOOR (O)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)

**Text Blocks:**
- BABA (B)
- YOU (2)
- FLAG (F)
- WIN (3)
- KILL (4)
- PUSH (5)
- STOP (6)
- MOVE (7)
- HOT (8)
- MELT (9)
- SINK (0)

**Current Active Rules:**
1. **BABA IS YOU**: The player controls BABA. This means BABA can move, push, and interact with other objects and text blocks.
2. **FLAG IS WIN**: The player needs to reach or make FLAG be in a winning position (not specified here but typically reaching a goal area).
3. **GOOP IS SINK**: GOOP destroys anything it touches, including itself when it falls on something marked as SINK.

### Analysis:
- **Goal:** Move BABA to a position where FLAG is under BABA or BABA can directly interact with FLAG to win.
- **Constraints:** GOOP is dangerous and can sink anything it touches, including BABA. 

### Plan:
1. **Move GOOP:** Since GOOP is SINK and can destroy anything it touches, move GOOP out of the way to a position where it won’t interfere with BABA’s path to FLAG.
2. **Create a Path:** Ensure BABA can reach FLAG without encountering GOOP.
3. **Win:** Position FLAG so that BABA can interact with it to win.

### Intermediate Actions:

**Step 1:** Move GOOP

- **Action:** BABA moves to space G10 and pushes GOOP.
- **Grid Update:**
  ```
  _B12gg..._
  _F13gg.f._
  _gbggg..._
  _g.gggggg_
  _g.gggggg_
  _g.gg...._
  _g....G10_
  _gggg...._
  _B12gg..._
  ```

**Step 2:** Ensure BABA can reach FLAG

- **Action:** Move BABA to space G9.
- **Grid Update:**
  ```
  _B12gg..._
  _F13gg.f._
  _gbggg..._
  _g.gggggg_
  _g.gggggg_
  _g.gg...._
  _g....G10_
  _gggg...._
  _B12gg..._
  ```

**Step 3:** Position FLAG

- **Action:** Move FLAG to space G11.
- **Grid Update:**
  ```
  _B12gg..._
  _F13gg.f._
  _gbggg..._
  _g.gggggg_
  _g.gggggg_
  _g.gg...._
  _g....G10_
  _gggg...._
  _B12gg..._
  _F11.g.W_
  ```

**Step 4:** Win

- **Action:** BABA moves to space G10 and interacts with FLAG.
- **Grid Update:** (No change needed, BABA is already in position to interact with FLAG)

**Final Grid:**
```
_B12gg..._
_F13gg.f._
_gbggg..._
_g.gggggg_
_g.gggggg_
_g.gg...._
_g....G10_
_gggg...._
_B12gg..._
_F11.g.W_
```

**Solution:** BABA wins by moving to space G10 and interacting with FLAG in G11.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is BABA wins by moving to G10 and interacting with FLAG in G11. I hope it is correct.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- GOOP (G)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- LOVE (V)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA. This means BABA can move, push, and interact with other objects and text blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The player needs to reach the FLAG to win the level.
- **GOOP IS SINK:** GOOP destroys anything it touches.
- **ROCK IS PUSH:** ROCK can be pushed by other objects.

**Level Layout:**
```
B12gg...    F13gg.f._ gbggg...    _g.gggggg_
_g.gggggg_   _g.gggggg_   _G.ggg.rr_
1.......    0R15g...    ...
```

### Analysis

**Current Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** BABA can move, push, and interact.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The objective is to reach the FLAG.
- **GOOP IS SINK:** GOOP destroys anything it touches.
- **ROCK IS PUSH:** ROCK can be moved by other objects.

**Objective:** Move BABA to the FLAG to win.

### Plan

1. **Move ROCK:** Since ROCK is PUSH, we can move it to block GOOP, preventing it from destroying BABA or the path to the FLAG.
2. **Move BABA:** Use BABA to push ROCK into position to block GOOP.
3. **Move GOOP:** If possible, move GOOP out of the way or use it to create a path to the FLAG.
4. **Reach FLAG:** Once the path is clear, move BABA to the FLAG.

### Intermediate Actions

**Step 1:** Move ROCK

- **Action:** BABA pushes ROCK.
- **Grid Update:**
```
B12gg...    F13gg.f._ gbggg...    _g.gggggg_
_R12ggg._   _g.gggggg_   _G.ggg.rr_
1.......    0R15g...    ...
```

**Step 2:** Position ROCK to block GOOP

- **Action:** Move ROCK to the space next to GOOP.
- **Grid Update:**
```
B12gg...    F13gg.f._ gbggg...    _g.gggggg_
_R12ggg._   _g.gggggg_   _G.ggg.rr_
1.......    0R15g...    _G.ggg.goop_
```

**Step 3:** Move GOOP if necessary

- **Action:** If possible, move GOOP out of the way.
- **Grid Update:** (Assuming GOOP can be moved to the side)
```
B12gg...    F13gg.f._ gbggg...    _g.gggggg_
_R12ggg._   _g.gggggg_   _G.ggg.rr_
1.......    0R15g...    _G.ggg.goop_
```

**Step 4:** Move BABA to the FLAG

- **Action:** Move BABA to the FLAG.
- **Grid Update:**
```
B12gg...    F13gg.f._ gbggg...    _g.gggggg_
_R12ggg._   _g.gggggg_   _G.ggg.rr_
1.......    0R15g...    _G.ggg.goop_
B........    ...
```

### Final Answer

The final answer is:
```
B12gg...    F13gg.f._ gbggg...    _g.gggggg_
_R12ggg._   _g.gggggg_   _G.ggg.rr_
1.......    0R15g...    _G.ggg.goop_

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B._
_1...b.1._
_8.....9._
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, LAVA IS HOT and BABA IS MELT.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- FLAG (F)
- LOVE (V)
- SKULL (S)
- GOOP (G)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- Empty spaces (_)

**Text Blocks:**
- **Object Text:** BABA, FLAG, LOVE, SKULL, GOOP, FLOOR, GRASS, ROCK, WALL, KEKE, G
- **Property Text:** 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 4 (KILL), 5 (PUSH), 6 (STOP), 7 (MOVE), 8 (HOT), 9 (MELT), 0 (SINK)

**Active Rules:**
1. **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA.
2. **FLAG IS WIN:** The player needs to reach FLAG to win.
3. **LAVA IS HOT:** LAVA destroys any object marked as HOT when they touch.
4. **BABA IS MELT:** BABA melts when touching anything marked as HOT.

**Level Layout:**
```
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B._
_1...b.1._
_8.....9._
_........_
_B12..F13_
```

### Analysis and Plan

**Objective:** Move BABA to FLAG to win.

**Constraints:**
- **BABA IS MELT:** BABA will melt when touching HOT.
- **LAVA IS HOT:** LAVA destroys any HOT object it touches.
- **BABA IS YOU:** BABA is controlled by the player.

**Initial Position:** BABA is at (1,1), FLAG is at (12,13), and LAVA is at (3,3).

**Observations:**
- **LAVA** is HOT and can destroy BABA if BABA moves towards it.
- **FLAG** is WIN and needs to be reached.
- **BABA IS MELT** makes BABA vulnerable to HOT objects.

**Plan:**
1. **Move BABA away from LAVA:** Ensure BABA does not move towards LAVA.
2. **Create a path to FLAG:** Use GOOP and WALL to block LAVA's path and create a safe route.
3. **Utilize LOVE:** If possible, use LOVE to create a bridge or block LAVA's path.

### Intermediate Actions

**Step 1:** Move BABA away from LAVA.

- Move BABA right to avoid LAVA: BABA moves to (1,2).

**Step 2:** Block LAVA's path.

- Push GOOP (G) at (8,9) towards LAVA.
- Move LOVE (V) from (13,12) to (9,9) to block LAVA further.

**Step 3:** Create a safe path to FLAG.

- Move WALL (W) from (13,12) to (12,12) to block LAVA further.
- Move BABA up to (1,10) to create space for LOVE to be moved.

**Step 4:** Move LOVE to block LAVA completely.

- Move LOVE (V) from (9,9) to (7,10).

**Step 5:** Move BABA towards FLAG.

- Move BABA right to (1,11).
- Move BABA up to (1,13).

**Step 6:** Ensure BABA can reach FLAG safely.

- Move WALL from (12,12) to (11,11) to block LAVA further.

**Final Position:** BABA at (1,13), FLAG at (12,13).

**Solution:**

```
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B._
_1...b.1._
_8.....9._
_........_
_B12..F13_
```

BABA is now at (1,13) and FLAG is at (12,13), satisfying the rule **FLAG IS WIN**. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is BABA at (1,13) and FLAG at (12,13). I hope it is correct.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (s)
- FLAG (f)
- FLOOR (o)
- GRASS (a)
- LAVA (l)
- ROCK (r)
- WALL (w)
- KEKE (k)
- GOOP (g)
- LOVE (v)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Text Blocks:**
- **Object Text:** BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, LAVA, ROCK, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE
- **Property Text:** 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 4 (KILL), 5 (PUSH), 6 (STOP), 7 (MOVE), 8 (HOT), 9 (MELT), 0 (SINK)

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** The player controls BABA. This means BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with other objects.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** The player needs to reach or make the FLAG object marked as WIN to win the level.
- **WALL IS STOP:** Walls (represented by 'W') are impassable. This rule is already applied since WALLs are inherently STOP.

### Plan

**Objective:** Move BABA to the FLAG to win the level.

**Constraints:**
- **WALL IS STOP:** BABA cannot move through walls.
- **BABA IS YOU:** BABA can move, push blocks, and interact with other objects.

### Solution Steps

**Step 1: Move BABA towards the FLAG**

Since BABA IS YOU, BABA can move freely except for walls. The initial position of BABA is at (1,1) and the FLAG is at (13,2).

**Step 2: Push the WALL blocking the path**

BABA needs to push the WALL (W) at (1,3) to create a path towards the FLAG.

**Step 3: Move BABA towards the FLAG**

After pushing the WALL, BABA can move towards the FLAG. However, there is another WALL at (1,4) blocking the path. BABA needs to push this WALL as well.

**Step 4: Push the second WALL**

BABA pushes the WALL at (1,4) to clear the path.

**Step 5: Reach the FLAG**

After clearing both walls, BABA can move to the position of the FLAG (13,2) to win the level.

### Intermediate Actions

**Action 1:** Move BABA to (1,2) and push the WALL at (1,3).

**Action 2:** Move BABA to (1,4) and push the WALL at (1,4).

**Action 3:** Move BABA to (13,2) and interact with the FLAG.

### Final Answer

The final answer is:
```
BABA
Moves to (1,2), pushes WALL at (1,3) -> Creates path.
Moves to (1,4), pushes WALL at (1,4) -> Clears path.
Moves to (13,2), interacts with FLAG -> Wins.
```
