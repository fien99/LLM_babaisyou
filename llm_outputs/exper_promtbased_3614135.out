<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

10. Push the rock to the right.
11. Move the BABA to the right to reach the sixth rock (r).
12. Push the rock to the right.
13. Move the BABA to the right to reach the seventh rock (r).
14. Push the rock to the right.
15. Move the BABA to the right to reach the eighth rock (r).
16. Push the rock to the right.
17. Move the BABA to the right to reach the ninth rock (r).
18. Push the rock to the right.
19. Move the BABA to the right to reach the tenth rock (r).
20. Push the rock to the right.
21. Move the BABA to the right to reach the eleventh rock (r).
22. Push the rock to the right.
23. Move the BABA to the right to reach the twelfth rock (r).
24. Push the rock to the right.
25. Move the BABA to the right to reach the thirteenth rock (r).
26. Push the rock to the right.
27. Move the BABA to the right to reach the fourteenth rock (r).
28. Push the rock to the right.
29. Move the BABA to the right to reach the fifteenth rock (r).

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

1. Move the BABA object to the FLAG object.
2. To do this, we need to move the ROCK objects out of the way.
3. We can change the ROCK IS PUSH rule to ROCK IS YOU, so we can control the ROCK objects.
4. Then, we can move the ROCK objects to the sides to clear a path for the BABA object to reach the FLAG object.
5. After clearing the path, we can change the ROCK IS YOU rule back to ROCK IS PUSH.
6. Finally, we can move the BABA object to the FLAG object to win the level.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give the intermediate actions.

1. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the first ROCK object.
2. Change the ROCK IS PUSH rule to ROCK IS YOU.
3. Move the ROCK object up and to the right to clear a path for the BABA object.
4. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the second ROCK object.
5. Move the ROCK object down and to the right to clear a path for the BABA object.
6. Change the ROCK IS YOU rule back to ROCK IS PUSH.
7. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object and wins the level.

Step 4: Show the answer.

The solution to the problem is:

1. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the first ROCK object.
2. Change the ROCK IS PUSH rule to ROCK IS YOU.
3. Move the ROCK object up and to the right to clear a path for the BABA object.
4. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the second ROCK object.
5. Move the ROCK object down and to the right to clear a path for the BABA object.
6. Change the ROCK IS YOU rule back to ROCK IS PUSH.
7. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object and wins the level.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_...rr..._
_..r.fr.._
_..r..r.._
_...rr..._
_.b......_
_.....R15_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and ROCK IS PUSH.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step 1: Understand the Level and Rules

**Objects:**
- BABA (B)
- SKULL (S)
- FLAG (F)
- FLOOR (O)
- GRASS (A)
- LAVA (L)
- ROCK (R)
- WALL (W)
- KEKE (K)
- GOOP (G)
- LOVE (V)
- _ (border)
- . (empty space)

**Property Text:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 4 = KILL
- 5 = PUSH
- 6 = STOP
- 7 = MOVE
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT
- 0 = SINK

**Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA and can move and push blocks.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** You need to move the FLAG to the goal position to win.
- **ROCK IS PUSH:** Rocks can be pushed by BABA.

### Analysis:
- **Goal:** Move BABA to the goal (FLAG) and push the FLAG to the winning position (R15).
- **Constraints:** 
  - **BABA IS YOU:** You control BABA.
  - **ROCK IS PUSH:** BABA can push ROCKS.
  - **FLAG IS WIN:** You win by moving the FLAG to R15.

### Plan:
1. **Move BABA to the position where it can push the ROCKS towards the FLAG.**
2. **Align the ROCKS to push the FLAG to R15.**
3. **Ensure no other obstacles are in the way.**

### Intermediate Actions:

**Step 1:** Move BABA to the first row.

**Step 2:** Push the ROCK in the second column to the left.

**Step 3:** Move the ROCK in the third column down.

**Step 4:** Move the ROCK in the fourth column up.

**Step 5:** Move the ROCK in the fifth column right.

**Step 6:** Move the FLAG in the sixth column down.

**Step 7:** Move the FLAG one more step to reach R15.

### Solution:

```

```

5. **Move ROCK in the fifth column right:**

```
_B1..F13_
_........_
_...rr..._
_..r.f.r.  (Rock moved right)
_..r..r.._
_...rr..._
_.b......_
_.....R15_
```

6. **Move FLAG in the sixth column down:**

```
_B1..F13_
_........_

_..r.f.r.  (Rock moved right)
_..r..r.._
_...rr..._
_..F13..  (FLAG moved down)
_.b......_
_.....R15_
```

7. **Move FLAG one more step to reach R15:**

```
_B1..F13_
_........_
_...rr..._
_..r.f.r.  (Rock moved right)
_..r..r.._
_...rr..._
_..F13..  (FLAG moved down)
_...R15   (FLAG reaches R15)
```

**Final Answer:** The final answer is _B1..F13_ _...rr..._ _..r..r.._ _...rr..._ _..F13.._ _...R15_ _.b......_ _.....R15_. I hope it is correct.
