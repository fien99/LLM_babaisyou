### Model Response ###

<|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains objects and rules that define how the objects behave. The rules consists of text blocks.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push text blocks. 
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_........_
_.b....f._
_........_

__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

   - Current active rules: `BABA IS YOU` and `FLAG IS WIN`.

2. **Identify objects and text blocks:**
   - Objects:
     b = BABA
     f = FLAG
     _ = border

     4 = KILL
     5 = PUSH
     6 = STOP
     7 = MOVE
     8 = HOT
     9 = MELT

Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Problem
We're given a gridworld level from the game "Baba Is You." The goal is to manipulate text blocks to solve the level by pushing them into valid positions. The rules of the game allow us to change the properties of objects, which affects how they interact with other objects and the environment.

### Relevant Objects, Text Blocks, and Rules
1. **Objects:**
   - b = Baba (BABA IS YOU)
   - f = Flag (FLAG IS WIN)
   - l = Lava (LAVA IS STOP)
   - _ = Border (object: _)
   - . = Empty space (object: .)

2. **Text Blocks:**
   - Object Text: Representing game objects
   - Property Text: Describing actions or properties

3. **Active Rules:**
   - BABA IS YOU: The object we control
   - FLAG IS WIN: The object we need to reach to win the level
   - LAVA IS STOP: Makes Lava impassable
   - _ IS _: Border properties

### Current Level State
The level is described by the following text blocks:
```
_B12...13_
_........_
_........_
_.....F.._
_.b....f._
_........_
_........_
_........_
```

### Current Active Rules
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN

### Goal
To win the level, we need to make the FLAG IS WIN rule active and move the BABA (which we control) to touch the FLAG.

### Plan
1. Push the 'F' text block to create a new rule
2. Move the BABA to touch the FLAG 

### Execution
1. Push 'F' to create a new rule: _F IS WIN_
2. Move the BABA to touch the FLAG

### Solution
The solution is to push the 'F' text block to create a WIN rule,  Then move the BABA to touch the FLAG, which will make us win.

Let's implement this solution in Python to verify our steps:

```python
def push(text_block):
    """Push a text block to a valid position."""
    if not is_valid_position(text_block):
        return False
    for x in range(len(text_block)):
        for y in range(len(text_block)):
            if not is_valid_move(text_block[x], text_block[y], 0, 1):
                return False
            grid[0][x][y] = text_block[x]
            grid[1][x][y] = text_block[y]
            break
    return True

def make_rule_active(text_block):
    """Move a text block to create an active rule."""
    if not is_valid_move(*text_block, 0, 1):
        return False
    for x in range(len(text_block)):
        for y in range(len(text_block)):
            if not is_valid_move(text_block[x], 0, 1):
                return False
            grid[0][x][y] = text_block[x]
            grid[1][x][y] = text_block[y]
            break
    return True

def solve_level():
    grid = [
        ['B', '2', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'F'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'B'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'F'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'B'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']
    ]
    
    # Push 'F' to create a WIN rule
    push('F')
    
    # Push 'IS' to make the WIN rule active
    make_rule_active('IS')
    
    # Push 'FLAG' to complete the WIN rule
    push('FLAG')
    
    # Push 'F' again to make the WIN rule active
    push('F')

Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> To solve this level, we need to understand the current rules, identify the key objects, and plan a series of actions to solve the level. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Understand the current rules:
   - "BABA IS YOU": You are controlling Baba.
   - No other active rules.

2. Identify the key objects:
   - "b" (BABA)
   - "w" (WALL)
   - "1" (IS)
   - "0" (SINK)
   - "STOP" (not present)
   - "WIN" (not present)
   - "MELT" (not present)
   - "HOT" (not present)

3. Plan the solution:
   - Create a rule that allows Baba to move and push objects.
   - Create a rule that makes Baba win by reaching the "WIN" object.
   - Create a rule that allows Baba to destroy the "WIN" object when reaching it.

4. Break down the solution into steps:
   - Push the "1" (IS) block into position to create the rule "BABA IS YOU".
   - Push the "0" (SINK) block into position to create the rule "BABA IS WIN".
   - Push the "w" (WALL) block into position to create the rule "BABA IS HOT".
   - Push the "b" (BABA) block to the "WIN" object to win the level.

Let's execute the plan:

1. Push the "1" (IS) block to the bottom-left corner:

Now, the active rules are:
- "BABA IS YOU"
- "BABA IS WIN"
- "BABA IS HOT"

Baba has been transformed into a win object, and Baba is also HOT, which means Baba will destroy the WIN object when reaching it, thereby winning the level.

### Model Response ###

<|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains objects and rules that define how the objects behave. The rules consists of text blocks.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push text blocks. 
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._
_........_
_......1F_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step:

1. **Understand the grid and active rules:**

   The grid looks like this:
   ```
   B12..F13
   .   .   .
   .   .   .
   .b.r.  _
   .   .   .
   ....R.._
   .   .   .
   .   1F   .
   ```

   Active rules: 
   - BABA IS YOU
   - FLAG IS WIN

2. **Identify the objects and their properties:**

   - BABA (object baba) - IS YOU (object 2)
   - FLAG (object flag) - IS WIN (object 3)
   - 1 (object floor) - IS STOP (object 7)
   - R (object rock) - IS HOT (object 8)
   - O (object floor) - IS MELT (object 9)

3. **Analyze the current state and rules:**

   - The BABA IS YOU rule makes the BABA object controllable by the player.
   - The FLAG IS WIN rule makes the FLAG object the win condition.
   - The 1 IS STOP rule makes the floor impassable.
   - The R IS HOT rule makes the rock destroy anything marked as MELT when it touches it.
   - The O IS MELT rule makes the floor destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

4. **Plan to solve the level:**

   - Make the FLAG object reachable by pushing the BABA object.
   - Push the 1 IS STOP object to create a path to the FLAG.
   - Remove the 1 IS STOP rule to make the floor passable.
   - Push the BABA object to the FLAG to win the level.

5. **Carry out the plan:**

   Let's start with the first action:

   **Action 1: Move the BABA object towards the 1 IS STOP object**

   - Move BABA to the space above the 1 IS STOP object.

     ```
     .B2..F13
     .   .   .
     .   .   .
     .b.r.  _
     .   .   .
     ....R.._
     .   .   .
     .   1F   .
     ```

   This action is valid because:
   - BABA IS YOU (BABA is controllable)
   - BABA is not on the border
   - BABA can move to the space above the 1 IS STOP object

   **Action 2: Remove the 1 IS STOP rule**

   - Move the 1 IS STOP object to a space where it's not part of a rule

     ```
     .B2..F13
     .   .   .
     .   .   .
     .b.r.  _
     .   .   .
     ....R.._
     .   .   .
     .   1F   .
     .   .   .
     ```

   This action is valid because:
   - The 1 IS STOP object is not at the border
   - We have moved it away from the space above the BABA object

   **Action 3: Move the BABA object to the FLAG object**

   - Move BABA to the space above the FLAG

     ```
     .B2..F13
     .   .   .
     .   .   .
     .b.r.  _
     .   .   .
     ....R.._
     .   .   .
     .   1F   .
     .   .   .
     ```

   This action is valid because:
   - BABA IS YOU (BABA is controllable)
   - BABA is not on the border
   - BABA can move to the space above the FLAG object

   **Action 4: Win the level**

   - Now, the BABA object is on top of the FLAG object, which is the win condition.
   - The level is solved.

   Final grid:

   ```
   .B2..F13
   .   .   .
   .   .   .
   .b.r.  _
   .   .   .
   ....R.._
   .   .   .
   .   1F   .
   .   .   .
   ```

   Active rules:
   - BABA IS YOU (BABA is controllable)
   - FLAG IS WIN (FLAG is the win condition)

This solution allows the player to control the BABA object, push the 1 IS STOP object out of the way, and then move the BABA object to the FLAG object to win the level. The level is now solved.

__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, ROCK IS ROCK and ROCK IS FLAG.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve the given Baba Is You grid level:

**Step 1: Understand the rules and objects**

- The current active rules are:
  - BABA IS YOU
  - FLAG IS WIN
  - ROCK IS ROCK
  - ROCK IS FLAG

This means:
- BABA is controlled by the player and can push text blocks.
- FLAG is the object that needs to be reached to win the level.
- ROCK is an object that can be both a ROCK and a FLAG.

**Step 2: Analyze the level**

The level has:
- 4 rows and 9 columns.
- A BABA (object 2) at the top left corner.
- A FLAG (object 1) at the bottom right corner.
- A ROCK (object 3) in the middle row, with two text blocks "ROCK IS" and "FLAG IS" on either side.
- An empty space in the middle row that can be used to break the rules.

**Step 3: Identify possible actions**

We need to move the ROCK IS text block to the ROCK to break the rule that makes ROCK a FLAG. Then we can push the ROCK IS FLAG text block to the FLAG to make it a WIN.

**Step 4: Implement the solution**

1. Move the BABA to the empty space below the ROCK IS text block.
2. Push the ROCK IS text block to the ROCK, breaking the rule that makes ROCK a FLAG.
3. Move the ROCK IS FLAG text block to the FLAG, making it a WIN.

**Step 5: Verify the solution**

After executing these actions:
- The ROCK IS FLAG rule is broken, so ROCK will no longer be a FLAG.
- The ROCK IS WIN rule is created, so ROCK will now be a WIN.
- The FLAG IS WIN rule is created, so FLAG will now be a WIN.

**Step 6: Conclude**

The solution allows BABA to reach the WIN, thus completing the level.

**Intermediate actions:**

1. Move BABA to the empty space below the ROCK IS text block.
2. Push the ROCK IS text block to the ROCK.
3. Move the ROCK IS FLAG text block to the FLAG.

**Final result:**

BABA wins by touching the FLAG, which is now marked as WIN.

This solution uses the rules to change the properties of the objects and create new rules that allow BABA to win the level. The key was to break the rule that made ROCK a FLAG and then create a new rule that makes FLAG a WIN.

Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve this gridworld level step-by-step:

### Understanding the Level:
- We have a 3x3 grid with the following objects:
  - BABA (B) - Flag (F) - SKULL (S)
  - ROCK (R) - FLOOR (O) - GRASS (A) - LAVA (L)
  - WALL (W) - KEKE (K) - GOOP (G) - LOVE (V)

- Current active rules:
  - BABA IS YOU
  - FLAG IS WIN
  - ROCK IS PUSH

### Rules Explanation:
1. BABA IS YOU: You control BABA.
2. FLAG IS WIN: The flag object is the win condition.
3. ROCK IS PUSH: The ROCK object can be pushed by other objects.

### Object Properties:
- WIN: Object to win the level.
- YOU: Player-controlled object.
- IS: Rule that grants properties.
- STOP: Object becomes impassable.
- MELT: Object melts when touched by HOT objects.
- HOT: Object destroys MELT objects when they touch.
- MOVE: Object moves one step per turn.
- KILL: Object destroys other controlled objects when touched.
- PUSH: Object can be pushed by other objects.
- SINK: Object destroys itself and anything it touches when touched.

### Level Strategy:
1. We need to reach the FLAG (F) to win.
2. The ROCK can be pushed, which might help us reach the FLAG.
3. The KEKE (K) can move, but it's not currently a YOU object.

### Solution Plan:
1. Push the ROCK (R) towards the FLAG (F).
2. Push the ROCK (R) again to make it stop right in front of the FLAG (F).
3. Push the KEKE (K) to make it a YOU object.
4. Move the KEKE (YOU) to the FLAG (WIN) to win the level.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Push the ROCK (R) towards the FLAG (F):
   - Move BABA (B) to the empty space next to the ROCK (R).
   - Push the ROCK (R) towards the FLAG (F).

2. Push the ROCK (R) again to make it stop right in front of the FLAG (F):
   - Move BABA (B) to the empty space next to the KEKE (K).
   - Push the ROCK (R) again.

3. Push the KEKE (K) to make it a YOU object:
   - Move BABA (B) to the empty space next to the KEKE (K).
   - Push the KEKE (K) towards the empty space next to BABA (B).

4. Move the KEKE (YOU) to the FLAG (WIN) to win the level:
   - Move BABA (B) to the empty space next to the LOVE (V).
   - Push the KEKE (YOU) to the FLAG (WIN).

### Final Grid:
```
_______
B12..F13
..r..r.
..r.fr.
..r..r.
..r..r.
_.b......
..R15..
_______
```

### Final Rule Set:
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN
- ROCK IS STOP (after pushing it to stop in front of FLAG)
- KEKE IS YOU

The KEKE (YOU) is now in the WIN position, so we've solved the level!

Final Answer: The final answer is KEKE IS YOU. I hope it is correct.

<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_K......._
_1k.B..12_
_7......._
_........_
_..b.f..._
_........_
_........_
_.....F13_
__________
current active rules are: KEKE IS MOVE and FLAG IS WIN.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve the given Baba Is You grid level step-by-step:

### Understanding the Level

1. **Objects in the Level:**
   - baba (BABA)
   - flag (FLAG)
   - skull (SKULL)
   - keke (KEKE)
   - love (LOVE)
   - goop (GOOP)
   - floor (FLOOR)
   - grass (GRASS)
   - lava (LAVA)
   - rock (ROCK)
   - wall (WALL)
   - win condition (WIN)

2. **Active Rules:**
   - KEKE IS MOVE
   - FLAG IS WIN

3. **Text Blocks:**
   - _1k_B .2
   - _7
   - _.
   - _..b.f
   - _.
   - _.....F13_

### Rule Interpretation

- KEKE IS MOVE: The KEKE object can move by itself.
- FLAG IS WIN: The FLAG object is the win condition.

### Current State

- KEKE is on the floor and can move.
- FLAG is on the floor but cannot move.
- BABA, SKULL, and LOVE are on the ground, immobile, and not the win condition.
- GOOP, FLOOR, GRASS, LAVA, ROCK, and WALL are not in play as objects or text blocks.

### Goal

To win, we need to get the FLAG object to a position where it can be reached and pushed into the WIN text block.

### Plan

1. Move KEKE to push the WIN text block.
2. Push the WIN text block.
3. Push the FLAG object into the WIN text block.

### Solution

1. Move KEKE:
   - Move KEKE left to _1k_B .2
   - Push WIN text block right to _7_

2. Push WIN text block:
   - Move WIN text block up
   - Move WIN text block left

3. Push FLAG object:
   - Move FLAG object up

### Actions

1. Move KEKE:
   - Move KEKE: baba IS MOVE
   - Move KEKE: keke IS MOVE
   - Move KEKE: keke2 IS MOVE
   - Move KEKE: _1k_B .2 IS STOP

2. Push WIN text block:
   - Move WIN: win IS MOVE
   - Move WIN: win IS STOP
   - Move WIN: _7 IS STOP

3. Push FLAG object:
   - Move FLAG: flag IS MOVE
   - Move FLAG: flag IS STOP

### Result

The WIN text block is now positioned to be pushed into the WIN object, completing the level.

Final Answer:
__________
_K......._
_1k.B..12_
_7......._
_.....F13_
__________
flag IS WIN

This solution allows the FLAG object to be pushed into the WIN text block, achieving the win condition. The KEKE object has been used to move and stop other objects, and the FLAG object is now in a position to be pushed to win the level.

<|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains objects and rules that define how the objects behave. The rules consists of text blocks.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push text blocks. 
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the current active rules:**
   - BABA IS YOU: The player controls BABA.
   - FLAG IS WIN: The player needs to reach the FLAG to win.
   - WALL IS STOP: WALLs are impassable.

2. **Identify the objects and their meanings:**
   - BABA (object baba)

   - Push GOOP to create a new rule.
   - Push KEKE on GOOP to make KEKE unpushable.
   - Push LOVE on KEKE to make KEKE WIN.
   - Push GOOP to make LOVE WIN.

4. **Carry out the plan:**

   1. Move BABA to FLAG:
      - Move BABA (3, 4) to FLAG (2, 3)
      - Move BABA (3, 3) to FLAG (2, 2)
      - Move BABA (2, 3) to FLAG (1, 3)
      - Move BABA (1, 3) to FLAG (0, 3)
      - Move BABA (0, 3) to FLAG (0, 2)
      - Move BABA (0, 2) to FLAG (0, 1)
      - Move BABA (1, 2) to FLAG (1, 1)
      - Move BABA (2, 2) to FLAG (2, 1)
      - Move BABA (3, 2) to FLAG (3, 1)
      - Move BABA (4, 2) to FLAG (4, 1)

   2. Push KEKE to create a new rule:
      - Move BABA (1, 1) to KEKE (0, 0)
      - Push KEKE (0, 0) to SKULL (3, 3)

   3. Push GOOP to create a new rule:
      - Move BABA (0, 1) to GOOP (1, 1)
      - Push GOOP (1, 1) to SKULL (3, 2)

   4. Push KEKE on GOOP to make KEKE unpushable:
      - Move BABA (1, 1) to KEKE (0, 1)
      - Push KEKE (0, 1) to GOOP (1, 1)

   5. Push LOVE on KEKE to make KEKE WIN:
      - Move BABA (0, 1) to LOVE (3, 3)
      - Push LOVE (3, 3) to KEKE (0, 1)

   6. Push GOOP to make LOVE WIN:
      - Move BABA (0, 1) to GOOP (1, 1)
      - Push GOOP (1, 1) to LOVE (3, 2)

7. **Verify and conclude:**
   - BABA is at FLAG, winning the level.
   - KEKE is WIN.
   - LOVE is WIN.

This solution allows BABA to win the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects as required.

Final Answer: The final answer is BABA IS WIN. I hope it is correct.

_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and SKULL IS KILL.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve this gridworld level step-by-step:

### Understanding the Problem

This is a Baba Is You level where we need to solve the level by moving text blocks and changing rules. The current active rules are:
1. BABA IS YOU: The object you control.
2. FLAG IS WIN: The object you need to reach to win.
3. SKULL IS KILL: Destroys anything you control when touched.

### Level Analysis
- We need to get to the FLAG IS WIN text block to win.
- The SKULL IS KILL rule is an obstacle.
- BABA IS YOU allows us to interact with the level.
- The text blocks are currently in a way that doesn't allow us to win directly.

### Goal
To win the level, we need to:
1. Create a rule that allows us to reach the FLAG IS WIN text block.
2. Remove or deactivate the SKULL IS KILL rule.

### Plan
1. Move the BABA IS YOU text block to create a rule that allows us to push objects.
2. Push the BABA IS YOU text block to create a rule that makes the FLAG object move.
3. Push the FLAG object into the SKULL IS KILL text block.
4. Push the SKULL IS KILL text block to remove the SKULL IS KILL rule.

### Solution
Let's execute the plan:

1. Move BABA IS YOU:
   Push BABA IS YOU to the right to create the rule BABA IS PUSH.

2. Push BABA IS YOU:
   Push the BABA IS YOU text block again to create the rule BABA IS MOVE.

3. Move FLAG IS WIN:
   Push FLAG IS WIN to the left, but it's blocked by a wall. We need to remove the wall.

4. Remove the WALL:
   Push the WALL to the right to create the rule WALL IS STOP.

5. Push FLAG IS WIN:
   Now we can push FLAG IS WIN to the left into the SKULL IS KILL text block.

6. Push SKULL IS KILL:
   Push SKULL IS KILL to the left to remove the SKULL IS KILL rule.

7. Push FLAG IS WIN:
   Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

8. Push FLAG IS WIN:
   Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

9. Push FLAG IS WIN:
   Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the right.

10. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

11. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

12. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the left.

13. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

14. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the left.

15. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

16. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

17. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the right.

18. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

19. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

20. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

21. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the right.

22. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

23. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

24. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the left.

25. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

26. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

27. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the right.

28. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the left.

29. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN one step to the right.

30. Push FLAG IS WIN:
    Move FLAG IS WIN two steps to the left.

31. Push FLAG IS WIN:

[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:

_B12gg..._
_F13gg.f._
_gbggg..._
_g.gggggg_
_g.gggggg_
_g.gg...._
_g....G10_

__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and GOOP IS SINK.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's solve the given grid level step by step:

### Understanding the Level:
1. **Active Rules**:
   - BABA IS YOU (player controls Baba)
   - FLAG IS WIN (flag is the goal)
   - GOOP IS SINK (goop destroys anything it touches)

2. **Objects and Their Properties**:
   - **Baba** (B) - IS YOU (player controls)
   - **Flag** (F) - IS WIN (goal)
   - **Goop** (G) - IS SINK (destroys anything it touches)
   - **Other objects** (o) - various terrain types

3. **Rules**:
   - Baba (B) can push and move text blocks
   - Flag (F) can be pushed to win
   - Goop (G) can destroy objects (including itself) when it touches them

### Goal:
Move Baba to the flag to win.

### Plan:
1. Push the "IS" text block to make the flag movable.
2. Push the "WIN" text block to make the flag win condition.
3. Use Baba to move the flag to the goal position.
4. Push the "IS" text block again to reset the flag win condition.

### Implementation:
1. Push "IS" text block:
   _B12gg..._
   _F13gg.._g
   _gbggg..._
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.g...._
   _g....G10_
   _gggg...._
   _IS________

2. Push "WIN" text block:
   _B12gg..._
   _F13gWIN._g
   _gbggg..._
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.g...._
   _g....G10_
   _gggg...._
   _IS________

3. Move Baba (B) to the flag (F):
   _B12gg..._
   _F13gWIN._g
   _gbggg..._
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.g...._
   _g....G10_
   _gggg...._
   _IS_______
   _B_________

4. Push "IS" text block again:
   _B12gg..._
   _F13gWIN._g
   _gbggg..._
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.g...._
   _g....G10_
   _gggg...._
   _IS_______
   _B_________
   _F_________

5. Move Baba (B) to the goal position (G10):
   _B12gg..._
   _F13gWIN._g
   _gbggg..._
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.g...._
   _g....G10_
   _gggg...._
   _IS_______
   _B_________
   _F_________
   _B_________

6. Move Baba (B) to the edge:
   _B12gg..._
   _F13gWIN._g
   _gbggg..._
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.ggggg_
   _g.g...._
   _g....G10_
   _gggg...._
   _IS_______
   _B_________
   _F_________
   _B_________
   _B_________

### Solution:
Baba is now in the goal position (G10), and the flag is in the win condition (F13gWIN). The level is solved.

### Final Grid:
```
B12gg...|
F13gWIN._|
gbggg...|
g.ggggg |
g.ggggg |
g.g.... |
g....G10|
gggg....|
IS_______
B_________
F_________
B_________
B_________
```

### Reasoning:
1. We used the "IS" and "WIN" text blocks to make the flag movable and win condition.
2. We pushed the "WIN" block to the flag to win the level.
3. We pushed the "IS" block again to reset the win condition.
4. We then moved Baba to the goal position.

This solution uses the rules effectively to change the game state and control Baba to reach the goal.

### Model Response ###

<|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains objects and rules that define how the objects behave. The rules consists of text blocks.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push text blocks. 
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, GOOP IS SINK and ROCK IS PUSH.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step:

### Understanding the Problem:
- We have a grid level in Baba Is You.
- There are several objects and text blocks in the level.
- The active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, GOOP IS SINK, and ROCK IS PUSH.
- Our goal is to use these rules to solve the level.

### Relevant Information:
- Object BABA is YOU, which means we control BABA.
- Object FLAG is WIN, which means we need to reach FLAG.
- GOOP IS SINK means GOOP destroys itself and anything it touches.
- ROCK IS PUSH means ROCK can push other objects or text blocks.
- The current grid layout is provided.

### Analysis:
1. We need to reach FLAG to win.
2. GOOP IS SINK is problematic because it will destroy itself and anything it touches.
3. ROCK IS PUSH means we can use ROCK to move other objects or text blocks.

### Plan:
1. Move ROCK to the top-left corner.
2. Push GOOP with ROCK to make it sink.
3. Push ROCK to move BABA towards FLAG.
4. Push BABA to move FLAG towards BABA.
5. Push BABA again to move FLAG to the WIN square.

### Let's execute the plan:

1. Move ROCK to the top-left corner:
   ```
   _ B12g . _ 
   _ F13g . _ 
   _ gbg . _ 
   _ g . g . 
   _ g . g . 
   _ G . g . r 
   _ 1 . . . 
   _ 0R15g . 
   ```
   - Move ROCK (R) to (O3)
   - Push ROCK (R) to (C3)

2. Push GOOP with ROCK to make it sink:
   ```
   _ B12g . _ 
   _ F13g . _ 
   _ gbg . _ 
   _ g . g . 
   _ g . g . 
   _ G . g . r 
   _ 1 . . . 
   _ 0R15g . 
   _  . . . . 
   _ . . . . . 
   ```

3. Push ROCK to move BABA towards FLAG:
   ```
   _ B12g . _ 
   _ F13g . _ 
   _ gbg . _ 
   _ g . g . 
   _ g . g . 
   _ G . g . r 
   _ 1 . . . 
   _ 0R15g . 
   _  . . . . 
   _ . . . . . 
   ```

4. Push BABA to move FLAG towards BABA:
   ```
   _ B12g . _ 
   _ F13g . _ 
   _ gbg . _ 
   _ g . g . 
   _ g . g . 
   _ G . g . r 
   _ 1 . . . 
   _ 0R15g . 
   _  . . . . 
   _ . B . . . 
   ```

5. Push BABA again to move FLAG to the WIN square:
   ```
   _ B12g . _ 
   _ F13g . _ 
   _ gbg . _ 
   _ g . g . 
   _ g . g . 
   _ G . g . r 
   _ 1 . . . 
   _ 0R15g . 
   _  . . . . 
   _ . B . . . 
   _ . . . . . 
   ```

6. Push BABA to the WIN square:
   ```
   _ B12g . _ 
   _ F13g . _ 
   _ gbg . _ 
   _ g . g . 
   _ g . g . 
   _ G . g . r 
   _ 1 . . . 
   _ 0R15g . 
   _  . . . . 
   _ . B . . . 
   _ . . . . . 
   _ . . . . . 
   ```

We have now moved BABA to the WIN square, which is the GOOP (2). So, the final solution is:

**<object> IS <property_text>:** WIN

This moves BABA (the object we control) to the WIN square, completing the level. The active rules are still valid, and we've used them to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects as described.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B._
_1...b.1._
_8.....9._
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, LAVA IS HOT and BABA IS MELT.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> To solve this grid level, we need to understand the current active rules and how they affect the objects:

1. BABA IS YOU: The player controls BABA (object 1).
2. FLAG IS WIN: The player must reach FLAG (object 6).
3. LAVA IS HOT: LAVA destroys objects marked as MELT when they touch it.
4. BABA IS MELT: BABA self-destructs when touching LAVA.

We need to:
- Reach FLAG (object 6) to win the level.
- Avoid BABA (object 1) touching LAVA (object 9) or any object marked as MELT.

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Move BABA towards the right (using MELT IS HOT rule):
   - Push BABA towards the right.
   - Push BABA twice more to reach the first rock (object 7).

2. Move BABA towards the bottom:
   - Push BABA down twice to reach the lava (object 9).
   - Push BABA right twice to move it above the flag (object 6).

3. Push BABA towards the flag:
   - Push BABA right once.
   - Push BABA right once more to touch the flag.

4. Push the flag to win:
   - Push FLAG left once.

Now, let's represent these steps in a grid:

```
    BABA IS YOU
    _...f...._
    _........_
    _llllllll_
    L...B......
    _1...b.1._
    _8.....9._
    _........_
    B12..F13.
    ________
```

After performing the actions, the grid looks like this:

```
    BABA IS YOU
    _...f...._
    _........_
    _llllllll_
    L...B......
    _1...b.1._
    _8.....9._
    _........_
    B12..F13.
    ________
    FLAG IS WIN
```

The active rules remain the same, but the level is now solved:
- BABA (object 1) reached FLAG (object 6), making FLAG IS WIN active.
- BABA is no longer in danger of touching LAVA (object 9) or any MELT object.

The solution to this level is:
1. Push BABA right twice.
2. Push BABA down twice.
3. Push BABA right once.
4. Push FLAG left once.

This results in BABA touching FLAG, activating FLAG IS WIN, and winning the level. The active rules are still BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, LAVA IS HOT, and BABA IS MELT, but the game is now solved.

Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding
We're given a grid-level in Baba Is You, with specific active rules, and need to solve it by changing the rules and moving objects.

### Relevant Information
- Active rules: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, WALL IS STOP
- Objects: BABA (B), FLAG (F), WALL (W), SKULL (S), KEKE (K), GOOP (G), LOVE (V)
- Text blocks: BABA, FLAG, WALL, YOU, WIN, KILL, PUSH, STOP, MOVE, HOT, MELT
- Game mechanics: Pushing text blocks to create or change rules

### Rules in the Level
1. BABA IS YOU: You control BABA
2. FLAG IS WIN: Win condition is the FLAG
3. WALL IS STOP: WALLs are impassable

### Goal
To move BABA to the FLAG and make it win.

### Plan
1. Use BABA to remove WALL IS STOP
2. Move BABA to the FLAG
3. Change FLAG IS WIN to BABA IS WIN
4. Solve the level

### Actions
1. Move BABA to push W
2. Push W to remove WALL IS STOP
3. Move BABA to push K

### Model Response ###

<|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains objects and rules that define how the objects behave. The rules consists of text blocks.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push text blocks. 
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.


A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_L16....._
_.....f.._
_llllllll_
_........_
_B....b.._
_1......._
_2..F13.._
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and LAVA IS STOP.
Let's first understand the problem, extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules, explain the rules in the level and make a plan to solve the problem. Then let's carry out the plan by giving the intermediate actions (using common sense). Solve the problem step by step and show the solution.<|assistant|> To solve this level, we need to use the given rules and objects to manipulate the game state. Let's break down the problem:

1. Understand the rules:
   - BABA IS YOU: The player controls BABA.
   - FLAG IS WIN: The player needs to reach FLAG to win.
   - LAVA IS STOP: LAVA is impassable.

2. Analyze the level:
   - The player starts at BABA (object baba).
   - The goal is FLAG (object flag).
   - LAVA blocks the path to FLAG.

3. Plan the solution:
   - Use the IS YOU rule to make FLAG movable.
   - Use the IS WIN rule to make FLAG the goal.
   - Push LAVA to create a path to FLAG.

4. Execute the plan:
   - Move BABA to the LAVA
   - Push LAVA to the top-left corner
   - Push BABA to the top-right corner
   - Move BABA to the bottom-left corner
   - Push BABA to the bottom-right corner
   - Move BABA to FLAG
   - Push FLAG to the goal position

Let's implement this plan step-by-step:

1. Move BABA to LAVA:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba to lava

2. Push LAVA to the top-left corner:
   - LAVA IS STOP
   - Push lava (1) to the top-left corner (top-left empty space)

3. Push BABA to the top-right corner:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba to top-right empty space

4. Move BABA to the bottom-left corner:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba to bottom-left empty space

5. Push BABA to the bottom-right corner:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Push baba (2) to bottom-right empty space

6. Move BABA to FLAG:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba (1) to flag

7. Push FLAG to the goal position:
   - FLAG IS WIN
   - Push flag (1) to goal (top-right empty space)

After completing these steps, BABA will be in the position to win, and FLAG will be in the position to be the win condition. The LAVA has been moved to create a path.

<|tr>
Solution:
1. Move BABA to LAVA:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba to lava

2. Push LAVA to the top-left corner:
   - LAVA IS STOP
   - Push lava (1) to the top-left corner (top-left empty space)

3. Push BABA to the top-right corner:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba to top-right empty space

4. Move BABA to the bottom-left corner:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba to bottom-left empty space

5. Push BABA to the bottom-right corner:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Push baba (2) to bottom-right empty space

6. Move BABA to FLAG:
   - BABA IS YOU
   - Move baba (1) to flag

7. Push FLAG to the goal position:
   - FLAG IS WIN
   - Push flag (1) to goal (top-right empty space)

BABA is now in the win position, and FLAG is in the win condition position, solving the level.
