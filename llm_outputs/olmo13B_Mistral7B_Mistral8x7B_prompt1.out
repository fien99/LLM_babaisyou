<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,

__________

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - Objects: b (baba), f (flag)
   - Text Blocks: B, F, 1 (IS), 3 (WIN)

2. **Initial State:**
   - The grid is:
     ```
     _B12..F13_
     _........_
     _........_
     _........_
     _.b....f._
     _........_
     _........_
     _........_
     ___________
     ```

3. **Active Rules:**
   - No active rules yet. We need to form valid rules.

4. **Objective:**
   - The goal is to reach the flag (f) to win the level.

5. **Plan:**
   - **Step 1:** Make `b IS YOU` so we can control the baba.
   - **Step 2:** Move the baba to the flag.
   - **Step 3:** Ensure `f IS WIN` so reaching the flag wins the level.

6. **Execution:**

   **Step 1: Form `b IS YOU`:**
   - Move the `B` block to align with `b`.
     ```
     _B12..F13_
     _........_
     _........_
     _........_
     _.b...f._
     _........_
     _........_
     _........_
     ___________
     ```
   - Now, `b IS YOU`.

   **Step 2: Move the baba to the flag:**
   - Move the baba (b) to the right.
     ```
     _B12..F13_
     _b....f._
     _........_
     _........_
     _........_
     _.b...f._
     _........_
     _........_
     _........_
     ___________
     ```
   - The baba is now next to the flag.

   **Step 3: Form `f IS WIN`:**
   - Move the `F` block to align with `f`.
     ```
     _B12..F13_
     _b....f._
     _........_
     _........_
     _........_
     _.b...f._
     _F....._
     _........_
     _........_
     ___________
     ```
   - Now, `f IS WIN`.

   **Final State:**
   - The baba is next to the flag, and the flag is marked as the winning condition.

   **Conclusion:**
   - Move the baba to the flag to win the level.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is to move the baba to the flag. I hope it is correct.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Identify Objects and Text Blocks**

- **Objects**: b (baba), r (rock), F (flag), R (rock), 1 (IS WIN)
- **Text Blocks**: B, S, F, O, A, L, R, W, K, G, V, 1

**Step 2: Understand the Initial State**

- The flag (F) is the WIN object.
- The baba (b) needs to reach the flag (F) to win.

**Step 3: Analyze the Grid**

- The flag (F) is blocked by a rock (R) to the right.
- We need to move the baba (b) to the flag (F).

**Step 4: Formulate a Plan**

1. **Move the Rock (R)**: We need to move the rock (R) to the left to clear the path for the baba (b).
2. **Move the Baba (b)**: Once the path is clear, move the baba (b) to the flag (F).

**Step 5: Implement the Plan**

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move the Rock (R)**:
   - Use the **"R IS PUSH"** rule to push the rock (R) to the left.
   - Move the rock (R) to the position: _...R...F_

2. **Move the Baba (b)**:
   - Use the **"b IS MOVE"** rule to move the baba (b) to the flag (F).
   - Move the baba (b) to the position: _...b.F_

**Final State:**

After executing the above steps, the baba (b) reaches the flag (F), and the level is solved.

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is: Move the rock (R) to _...R...F_ and then move the baba (b) to _...b.F_. I hope it is correct.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - Objects: b (Baba), s (Skull), f (Flag), S (Skull text block), F (Flag text block), 
   - Text Blocks: 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 12 (IS), 13 (WIN), 
   - Other blocks: . (empty), _ (border).

2. **Initial Rules and Constraints:**
   - Skull (s) is marked as "KILL" (S14), meaning it destroys Baba (b) when they touch.
   - Baba (b) needs to reach Flag (f) to win (F13).

3. **Objective:**
   - Move Baba (b) to Flag (f) to win.

4. **Plan:**
   - **Step 1:** Make Baba (b) immune to Skull (s) by changing the rule "S IS KILL" to "S IS PUSH".
   - **Step 2:** Ensure Baba (b) can move freely by making "b IS MOVE".
   - **Step 3:** Move Baba (b) around the Skull (s) to reach Flag (f).

### Intermediate Actions:

**Step 1: Change "S IS KILL" to "S IS PUSH"**

- Move the "IS" block to align with "S" and "PUSH" to form "S IS PUSH".

```
__________
_........_
_S14....._
_....sss._
_.b..sfs._
_....sss._
_........_
_........_
_B12..F13_

_....sss._
_.b..sfs._
_....sss._
_........_
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
```

**Step 3: Move Baba (b) to Flag (f)**

- Now that Baba (b) can move and Skull (s) only pushes, navigate Baba around the Skull to reach the Flag.

```
_........_
_....sss._
_.b..sfs._
_....sss._
_........_
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
```

**Final Move:**

- Move Baba (b) directly to the Flag (f).

```
_........_
_....sss._
_.b..f..s_
_....sss._
_........_
_........_
_B12..F13_

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,

    0 = SINK

objects in the game:

    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - **Objects:** b (Baba), s (Skull), f (Flag), o (Floor), a (Grass), l (Lava), r (Rock), w (Wall), k (Keke), g (Goop), v (Love)
   - **Text Blocks:** 
     - Object Text: B, S, F, O, A, L, R, W, K, G, V
     - Property Text: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0

2. **Active Rules:**
   - **Current Rules:** None, as no text blocks are aligned to form a rule.

3. **Goal:**
   - **Flag IS WIN:** We need to move the Flag to the winning position.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The Flag (F) is initially blocked by Goop (G).
   - We need to clear the Goop to move the Flag.

5. **Plan:**
   - **Step 1:** Make the Skull (S) "IS PUSH" to push the Goop (G).
   - **Step 2:** Move the Flag (F) once the Goop (G) is cleared.

6. **Execution:**

   **Step 1: Form the Rule "S IS PUSH"**
   - Move the "S" (Skull) to align with "IS PUSH".
   ```
   _B12gg..._
   _F13gg.f._
   _gbggg..._
   _g.gggggg_
   _g.gggggg_
   _G.ggg.rr_
   _1......._
   _0R15g..._
   ```
   - Move the "S" (Skull) to the right to align with "IS PUSH":
   ```
   _B12ggs..._
   _F13gg.f._
   _gbggg..._
   _g.gggggg_
   _g.gggggg_
   _G.ggg.rr_
   _1......._
   _0R15g..._
   ```

   **Step 2: Push the Goop (G)**
   - Move the Skull (S) to push the Goop (G) out of the way.
   ```
   _B12ggs..._
   _F13g...f._
   _bgggg..._
   _g.gggggg_
   _g.gggggg_
   _G.ggg.rr_
   _1......._
   _0R15g..._
   ```

   **Step 3: Move the Flag (F)**
   - Move the Flag (F) to the winning position.
   ```
   _B12ggs..._
   _F13...f._
   _bgggg..._
   _g.gggggg_
   _g.gggggg_
   _G.ggg.rr_
   _1......._
   _0R15g..._
   ```
   - Move the Flag (F) to the right:
   ```
   _B12ggs..._
   _...f._
   _bgggg..._
   _g.gggggg_
   _g.gggggg_
   _G.ggg.rr_
   _1......._
   _0R15g..._
   ```
   - Move the Flag (F) again:
   ```
   _B12ggs..._
   _...f._
   _bgggg..._
   _g.gggggg_
   _g...rr_
   _1......._
   _0R15g..._
   ```

   **Final State:**
   - The Flag (F) is in the winning position.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is the Flag (F) in the winning position. I hope it is correct.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - **Objects:** f (flag), B (baba), b (baba), L (lava), W (wall), . (empty space)
   - **Text Blocks:** 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 8 (HOT), 9 (MELT), 12 (MOVE), 13 (WIN)

2. **Initial Rules and Constraints:**
   - The flag (f) is the winning condition (object f IS WIN).
   - Baba (B) can control and move objects.
   - Lava (L) is HOT and can melt objects marked as MELT.
   - Walls (W) are impassable.

3. **Objective:**
   - Move baba (B) to the flag (f) to win the level.

4. **Plan:**
   - **Step 1:** Make baba (B) controllable by aligning B IS YOU.
   - **Step 2:** Ensure baba (B) can move by aligning B IS MOVE.
   - **Step 3:** Melt the wall (W) using lava (L) to create a path.
   - **Step 4:** Move baba (B) to the flag (f).

5. **Intermediate Actions:**

   **Step 1: Align B IS YOU**
   - Move the B text block to align with the "IS YOU" text block.
   ```

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Grid and Objects**

- **Grid Layout**:
  ```
  ________
  _........_
  _..k..f.._
  _wwwwwwww_
  _.......W_
  _..K..b.1_
  _.......6_
  _B12....._
  _.....F13_
  ________
  ```

- **Objects**:
  - `b`: Baba (b)
  - `k`: Keke (k)
  - `f`: Flag (f)
  - `w`: Wall (w)
  - `K`: Skull (s)
  - `b1`: Baba (b) (since `1` is `IS YOU`)
  - `W`: Win (W)
  - `Kb`: Keke-Baba combination (since `b` is next to `k`)
  - `B12`: Baba (b), 1 (IS YOU), 2 (IS WIN)
  - `F13`: Flag (f), 1 (IS YOU), 3 (IS WIN)

- **Text Blocks**:
  - `1`: IS YOU
  - `2`: IS WIN
  - `6`: STOP
  - `B`: Baba
  - `F`: Flag
  - `W`: Win

**Step 2: Identify Initial Rules and Objectives**

- **Initial Rules**:
  - `b IS YOU`: Baba is controllable.
  - `k IS KILL`: Keke kills anything it touches.
  - `f IS WIN`: Flag is the win condition.
  - `w IS WALL`: Walls are impassable.
  - `K IS STOP`: Skull stops movement.
  - `b1 IS YOU`: Baba is controllable.
  - `W IS WIN`: Win condition is reaching the Win block.

**Step 3: Devise a Plan**

1. **Move Baba (b) to `b1`**: Baba needs to control the `b1` block to become `IS YOU`.
2. **Move Baba (b1) to `W`**: Move to the Win block to win the level.

**Step 4: Intermediate Actions**

- **Move Baba (b) to `b1`**:
  - Push the `w` (Wall) down to open a path.
  ```
  ________
  _........_
  _..k..f.._
  _w......w_
  _.......W_
  _..K..b.1_
  _.......6_
  _B12....._
  _.....F13_
  ________
  ```
  - Move Baba (b) to `b1`.

  ```

  _w......w_
  _.......W_
  _..K..b1_
  _.......6_
  _B12....._
  _.....F13_
  ________
  ```

- **Move Baba (b1) to `W`**:
  - Push the `K` (Skull) to the right to clear a path.
  ```
  ________
  _........_
  _..k..f.._
  _w......w_
  _.......W_
  _..b1..._
  _.......6_
  _B12....._

  ________
  ```
  - Move Baba (b1) to `W`.

  ```
  ________
  _........_
  _..k..f.._
  _w......w_
  _.......W_
  _..b1W.._
  _.......6_
  _B12....._
  _.....F13_
  ________
  ```

**Step 5: Final State**

- **Final State**:
  ```
  ________
  _........_
  _..k..f.._
  _w......w_
  _.......W_
  _..b1W.._
  _.......6_
  _B12....._
  _.....F13_
  ________
  ```

**Conclusion**:

By following the plan and executing the intermediate actions, Baba reaches the Win block (`W`) to win the level.

**Final Answer**: The final answer is `W`. I hope it is correct.

- Floor (F)

We have the following text blocks:
- B12 (Baba is you)
- F13 (Flag is win)

We have the following rules:
- Baba is you (You control Baba)
- Flag is win (To win, you need to reach the flag)

The goal is to move Baba to the flag.

Plan:
1. Move Baba to the flag.

Intermediate Actions:
1. Move Baba to the position of the flag (b.b...f.)
2. Move Baba to the position of the flag (b...f.)
3. Move Baba to the position of the flag (b.f.)
4. Move Baba to the position of the flag (bf.)
5. Move Baba to the position of the flag (bf)

- 13 (WIN IS F)

The rules in this level are:
- Baba is controlled by you (B IS YOU)
- The flag is the win condition (WIN IS F)

The goal is to move the flag to the exit (13) using the Baba.

Plan:
1. Move Baba to the flag (B IS YOU, move Baba to the position of the flag)
2. Make Baba the flag (B IS F)
3. Move the flag to the exit (F IS MOVE)
4. Win the level (WIN IS F)

Intermediate actions:
1. Move Baba to the flag (B IS YOU, move Baba to the position of the flag)
  - Move Baba to the position of the flag (b -> bb)
  - Move Baba to the position of the flag (b -> bf)

2. Make Baba the flag (B IS F)
  - Change the rule to make Baba the flag (B IS F)

3. Move the flag to the exit (F IS MOVE)
  - Change the rule to make the flag move (F IS MOVE)
  - Move the flag to the exit (F -> F12)

4. Win the level (WIN IS F)
  - Check if the flag is at the exit (WIN IS F)

Answer:
The solution to the given level is to move Baba to the flag, make Baba the flag, make the flag move, and move the flag to the exit. The final arrangement of the text blocks would be:

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In this level, we have the following objects:
- Baba (b)
- Skull (s)
- Flag (f)
- Floor (o)
- Grass (a)
- Lava (l)
- Rock (r)
- Wall (w)
- Keke (k)
- Goop (g)
- Love (v)

In this level, we have the following text blocks:
- IS
- YOU
- WIN
- KILL
- PUSH
- STOP
- MOVE
- HOT
- MELT
- SINK

In this level, we have the following active rules:
- B IS YOU
- F IS WIN
- R IS STOP
- R IS SINK

The goal of the level is to move the flag (F) to the exit (the empty space at the top right corner).

Plan:
1. Move Baba (b) to the position of the flag (F) using the PUSH rule.
2. Change the rule B IS YOU to F IS YOU, making the flag (F) the controlled object.
3. Move the flag (F) to the exit (the empty space at the top right corner) using the MOVE rule.

Intermediate actions:
1. Move Baba (b) to the position of the flag (F).
  - Push the rock (r) at position R1 to the right, creating a path for Baba (b) to move to the position of the flag (F).
  - Move Baba (b) to the position of the flag (F).

2. Change the rule B IS YOU to F IS YOU.
  - Move the text block B IS YOU to the position of the flag (F).
  - Move the text block F IS WIN to the position of Baba (b).
  - Move the text block B IS YOU to the position of Baba (b).

3. Move the flag (F) to the exit (the empty space at the top right corner).
  - Move the flag (F) to the right, using the MOVE rule.
  - Move the flag (F) up, using the MOVE rule.

Answer:
The solution to the level is to move Baba (b) to the position of the flag (F), change the rule B IS YOU to F IS YOU, and move the flag (F) to the exit (the empty space at the top right corner). The final active rules will be F IS YOU, F IS WIN, R IS STOP, and R IS SINK.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In this level, we have the following objects:
- b (baba)
- f (flag)
- B (baba, you control)
- 1 (number 1)
- 2 (number 2)
- 3 (number 3)
- W (wall)
- w (wall)
- . (empty space)

We have the following text blocks:
- IS (property text)
- YOU (property text)
- WIN (property text)
- KILL (property text)
- PUSH (property text)
- STOP (property text)
- SINK (property text)
- MELT (property text)
- HOT (property text)
- MOVE (property text)

We have the following rules:
- B IS YOU (You control the baba)
- B IS WIN (The goal is to move the baba to the flag)
- f IS STOP (The flag is impassable)
- 1 IS MELT (The number 1 melts objects)
- 2 IS HOT (The number 2 is hot)
- 3 IS KILL (The number 3 kills objects)
- 6 IS PUSH (The number 6 can be pushed)
- B12 IS MOVE (The baba moves to the flag when it is next to the number 12)
- B13 IS KILL (The baba kills the flag when it is next to the number 13)

Plan:
1. Move the baba to the number 12 to make it move towards the flag.
2. Move the number 1 to the number 2 to make the number 1 hot.
3. Move the number 1 to the number 3 to make the number 1 kill the flag.
4. Move the baba to the flag to win the level.

Intermediate actions:
1. Move the baba to the number 6.
2. Move the number 6 to the number 12.
3. Move the baba to the number 12.
4. Move the number 1 to the number 2.
5. Move the number 1 to the number 3.
6. Move the baba to the flag.

Answer: The baba moves to the number 6, then to the number 12, then to the number 1, then to the number 2, then to the number 3, and finally to the flag. The number 1 melts the number 3, killing the flag. The baba wins the level.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In this level, we have the following objects:
- Baba (b)
- Skull (s)
- Flag (f)
- Rock (r)
- Lava (l)
- Grass (a)
- Wall (w)

We have the following text blocks:
- S14
- b12
- f13

We have the following rules:
- S14 IS YOU
- b12 IS BABA
- f13 IS FLAG

The goal is to move the flag to the exit (position B13).

Plan:
1. Move the S14 block to position B12, making the skull the controlled object.
2. Move the skull to position B13, placing the flag on the exit.
3. Move the S14 block back to position S14, making the player the controlled object again.

Intermediate actions:
1. Move the S14 block to position B12.
  - Move the S14 block to the right until it reaches the right border.
  - Move the S14 block down until it reaches position B12.

2. Move the skull to position B13.
  - Move the skull to the right until it reaches position B13.

3. Move the S14 block back to position S14.
  - Move the S14 block to the left until it reaches the left border.
  - Move the S14 block up until it reaches position S14.

Answer:
The solution to the level is to move the S14 block to position B12, making the skull the controlled object. Then, move the skull to position B13, placing the flag on the exit. Finally, move the S14 block back to position S14, making the player the controlled object again.

The final grid after the solution would look like this:

_..K..b.1_
_.......6_
_B12....._
_.....F13_

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In this level, we have the following objects:
- Baba (b)
- Skull (s)
- Flag (f)
- Keke (k)
- Goop (g)
- Love (v)
- Wall (w)
- Rock (r)
- Lava (l)
- Floor (o)

We have the following text blocks:
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 6
- b
- f
- k
- g
- v
- w
- r
- l
- o

The active rules in the level are not explicitly shown, but we can infer some rules from the given level:
- The player controls Baba (b), as it is marked with the "1" text block.
- The goal is to reach the flag (f) marked with the "3" text block.
- The walls (w) are impassable, as they are blocking the path.
- The lava (l) is hot, as it is melting the goop (g) that is in contact with it.
- The rock (r) is immovable, as it is not being pushed by Baba (b).
- The floor (o) is not specified to have any properties, but it is not melted by the lava (l).

To solve the level, we need to move Baba (b) to the flag (f) while avoiding the lava (l) and the walls (w). Here's a plan to solve the level:

1. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost keke (k) using the "PUSH" rule.
2. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost keke (k) using the "PUSH" rule.
3. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost wall (w) using the "PUSH" rule.
4. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost wall (w) using the "PUSH" rule.
5. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost skull (s) using the "PUSH" rule.
6. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost skull (s) using the "PUSH" rule.
7. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost lava (l) using the "PUSH" rule.
8. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost lava (l) using the "PUSH" rule.
9. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost goop (g) using the "PUSH" rule.
10. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost goop (g) using the "PUSH" rule.
11. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost floor (o) using the "PUSH" rule.
12. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost floor (o) using the "PUSH" rule.
13. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost flag (f) using the "PUSH" rule.

Now, let's carry out the plan:

1. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost keke (k) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) to the leftmost keke (k).

2. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost keke (k) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) up to the topmost keke (k).

3. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost wall (w) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) to the leftmost wall (w).

4. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost wall (w) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) up to the topmost wall (w).

5. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost skull (s) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) to the leftmost skull (s).

6. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost skull (s) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) up to the topmost skull (s).

7. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost lava (l) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) to the leftmost lava (l).

8. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost lava (l) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) up to the topmost lava (l).

9. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost goop (g) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) to the leftmost goop (g).

10. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost goop (g) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) up to the topmost goop (g).

11. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost floor (o) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) to the leftmost floor (o).

12. Move Baba (b) up to the topmost floor (o) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) up to the topmost floor (o).

13. Move Baba (b) to the leftmost flag (f) using the "PUSH" rule.
  - Move Baba (b) to the leftmost flag (f).

Now, Baba (b) is in contact with the flag (f), so the level is solved. The final grid would look like this:

__________
_........_
_..k..f.._
_wwwwwwww_
_.......W_
_..K..b.1_
_.......6_
_B12....._
_.....F13_
__________

Baba (b) is on the flag (f), so the level is won.

__________

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Answer:

1. Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules in the given level.

The given level contains the following objects and text blocks:

- Objects: BABA (B), FLOOR (o), GRASS (a), WALL (w), ROCK (r), SKULL (s), FLAG (f)
- Text blocks: B IS YOU, F IS WIN

The rules in the given level are:
- B IS YOU: BABA is the object you control in the game.
- F IS WIN: The FLAG is the object you need to reach to win the level.

2. Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the level, we need to move the BABA object to the FLAG object. To do this, we need to clear a path for the BABA object to reach the FLAG object. We can do this by pushing the ROCK objects out of the way.

3. Carry out the plan.

Step 1: Move the BABA object to the left until it reaches the ROCK object.
Step 2: Push the ROCK object to the left until it falls into the empty space.
Step 3: Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the next ROCK object.
Step 4: Push the ROCK object to the right until it falls into the empty space.
Step 5: Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object and wins the level.

Intermediate actions:

- Move BABA object to the left until it reaches the ROCK object.
- Push ROCK object to the left until it falls into the empty space.
- Move BABA object to the right until it reaches the next ROCK object.
- Push ROCK object to the right until it falls into the empty space.
- Move BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object and wins the level.

Final answer:

- Move BABA object to the left until it reaches the ROCK object.
- Push ROCK object to the left until it falls into the empty space.
- Move BABA object to the right until it reaches the next ROCK object.
- Push ROCK object to the right until it falls into the empty space.
- Move BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object and wins the level.

A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Answer:

1. Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules in the given level.

The given level contains the following objects and text blocks:

- Objects: BABA, FLOOR, FLAG, ROCK, WALL, and BABA (b).
- Text blocks: BABA, IS, YOU, FLOOR, IS, WIN, ROCK, IS, STOP, WALL, IS, MELT, and 1.

The rules in the given level are:

- BABA IS YOU: This rule makes BABA the object you control in the game.
- FLOOR IS WIN: This rule means that you need to reach the FLOOR to win the level.
- ROCK IS STOP: This rule makes the ROCK impassable (you can’t move through it).
- WALL IS MELT: This rule means that the WALL will destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it.
- 1: This text block is not part of any rule, so it doesn’t have any meaning in the game.

2. Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to reach the FLOOR and make it the WIN object. To do this, we need to change the rule FLOOR IS WIN to BABA IS WIN.

3. Carry out the plan and give the intermediate actions.

Step 1: Move the BABA object to the right until it is in the same row as the IS text block.
Step 2: Move the IS text block to the right until it is in the same column as the BABA object.
Step 3: Move the BABA object up until it is in the same row as the YOU text block.
Step 4: Move the YOU text block to the right until it is in the same column as the BABA object.
Step 5: Move the BABA object up until it is in the same row as the FLOOR object.
Step 6: Move the FLOOR object to the right until it is in the same column as the IS text block.
Step 7: Move the IS text block up until it is in the same row as the FLOOR object.
Step 8: Move the FLOOR object up until it is in the same row as the WIN text block.
Step 9: Move the WIN text block to the right until it is in the same column as the FLOOR object.
Step 10: Move the FLOOR object up until it is in the same row as the BABA object.
Step 11: Move the BABA object up until it is in the same row as the WIN text block.
Step 12: Move the WIN text block to the right until it is in the same column as the BABA object.

4. Solve the problem step by step and show the answer.

Step 1: Move the BABA object to the right.

Step 9: Move the WIN text block to the right.

_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._
_........_
_......1F_

Step 10: Move the FLOOR object up.

_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._

_......1F_

Step 11: Move the BABA object up.

_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._

Step 12: Move the WIN text block to the right.

_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._
_........_
_......1F_

Now, the BABA object is in the same row as the WIN text block, and the FLOOR object is in the same row as the YOU text block. This means that the BABA object is now the WIN object, and we have solved the problem.

Final answer: The solution is to move the BABA object up until it is in the same row as the WIN text block, and then move the WIN text block to the right until it is in the same column as the BABA object.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Answer:

1. Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules in the given level.

The given level contains the following objects and text blocks:

- Objects: BABA (B), FLOOR (o), ROCK (r), WALL (w), FLAG (F)
- Text blocks: B IS YOU, F IS WIN

2. Devise a plan to solve the problem.

The goal is to move the BABA object to the FLAG object. To do this, we need to make the BABA object controllable (B IS YOU) and reach the FLAG object (F IS WIN).

3. Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

Step 1: Move the B IS YOU text block to the left of the BABA object.
- Move the B IS YOU text block to the left, so it aligns horizontally with the BABA object.

Step 2: Move the BABA object to the FLAG object.
- Move the BABA object to the right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up,

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules in the given level.

The grid level contains the following objects and text blocks:

Objects:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)
- KEKE (k)
- ROCK (r)
- WALL (w)
- FLOOR (o)
- GOOP (g)
- LOVE (v)

Text Blocks:
- IS (1)
- YOU (2)
- WIN (3)
- KILL (4)
- PUSH (5)
- STOP (6)
- MOVE (7)
- HOT (8)
- MELT (9)
- SINK (0)

Rules:
- K IS YOU: Makes the KEKE object you control in the game.
- F IS WIN: The FLAG object you need to reach to win the level.
- B IS PUSH: Lets you push the BABA object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
- 1k.B..12: This rule is not a valid rule, as it does not follow the format <object_text> IS <property_text>.
- 7.......: This rule is not a valid rule, as it does not follow the format <object_text> IS <property_text>.
- ........: This rule is not a valid rule, as it does not follow the format <object_text> IS <property_text>.
- ..b.f...: This rule is not a valid rule, as it does not follow the format <object_text> IS <property_text>.
- ........: This rule is not a valid rule, as it does not follow the format <object_text> IS <property_text>.
- .....F13: This rule is not a valid rule, as it does not follow the format <object_text> IS <property_text>.

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to reach the FLAG object and make it the object you control. To do this, we need to change the rule F IS WIN to F IS YOU.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules.

The grid level is a 9x9 grid with 16 non-empty cells. The non-empty cells contain 10 text blocks, 4 objects, and 2 empty spaces.

The objects in the grid are:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)
- WALL (w)
- ROCK (r)

The text blocks in the grid are:
- IS (1)
- YOU (2)
- WIN (3)
- STOP (6)
- MOVE (7)
- F (f)
- B (b)

The rules in the grid are:
- F IS WIN
- B IS YOU

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to make BABA (b) the object we control and reach the FLAG (f) to win the level. Currently, the rule B IS YOU makes BABA (b) the object we control, but we need to make sure that BABA (b) can move to the FLAG (f).

To do this, we need to remove the WALL (w) and ROCK (r) objects that are blocking the path to the FLAG (f). We can use the rule STOP (6) to make the WALL (w) and ROCK (r) objects impassable, so that BABA (b) cannot move through them.

However, we cannot directly apply the rule STOP (6) to the WALL (w) and ROCK (r) objects, because they are not currently the object we control. To solve this problem, we can use the rule MOVE (7) to make the WALL (w) and ROCK (r) objects move one step in their direction every turn. This will allow us to push them out of the way and reach the FLAG (f).

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give the intermediate actions.

To carry out the plan, we need to perform the following actions:

1. Move BABA (b) to the right until it reaches the WALL (w) object.
2. Push the WALL (w) object to the right until it reaches the ROCK (r) object.
3. Push the ROCK (r) object to the right until it reaches the FLAG (f) object.
4. Move BABA (b) to the right until it reaches the FLAG (f) object and wins the level.

Step 4: Show the answer.

The answer is:

1. Move BABA (b) to the right until it reaches the WALL (w) object.
2. Push the WALL (w) object to the right until it reaches the ROCK (r) object.
3. Push the ROCK (r) object to the right until it reaches the FLAG (f) object.
4. Move BABA (b) to the right until it reaches the FLAG (f) object and wins the level.

Note: The above answer assumes that the WALL (w) and ROCK (r) objects are not already moving in their direction every turn. If they are, then we need to use the rule STOP (6) to make them impassable before pushing them out of the way.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Answer:

1. Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules:
  Objects: BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, WALL
  Text Blocks:
  - B IS YOU: BABA is the object you control.
  - F IS WIN: You need to reach the FLAG to win the level.
  - S IS KILL: SKULL destroys anything you control when touched.
  - S IS MELT: SKULL melts when touched by something marked as HOT.
  - L IS HOT: LAVA is marked as HOT.
  - R IS PUSH: ROCK can be pushed.
  - W IS STOP: WALL is impassable.

2. Devise a plan to solve the problem:
  - Make BABA immune to SKULL by changing B IS YOU to B IS BABA.
  - Make SKULL destroy itself when touching LAVA by changing S IS MELT to S IS KILL.
  - Make BABA able to push ROCK by changing R IS PUSH to R IS YOU.
  - Make BABA move towards the FLAG by changing F IS WIN to F IS YOU.

3. Carry out the plan:
  - Move the B IS YOU text block to the right of the BABA text block, forming B IS BABA.
  - Move the S IS MELT text block to the right of the S text block, forming S IS KILL.
  - Move the R IS PUSH text block to the right of the R text block, forming R IS YOU.
  - Move the F IS WIN text block to the right of the F text block, forming F IS YOU.

4. Intermediate actions:
  - BABA is now immune to SKULL.
  - SKULL destroys itself when touching LAVA.
  - BABA can push ROCK.
  - BABA moves towards the FLAG.

5. Solve the problem step by step:
  - Push the ROCK to the right to reveal the LAVA.
  - Move BABA to the right to touch the LAVA, causing the SKULL to self-destruct.
  - Move BABA to the right to reach the FLAG and win the level.

Answer: The solution is to make BABA immune to SKULL, make SKULL destroy itself when touching LAVA, make BABA able to push ROCK, and make BABA move towards the FLAG. The intermediate actions include pushing the ROCK to the right to reveal the LAVA, moving BABA to the right to touch the LAVA, and moving BABA to the right to reach the FLAG and win the level.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem

The grid level is a 9x9 grid with 10 objects and 14 text blocks. The objects are BABA, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, GOOP, and GOOP. The text blocks are B, 1, 2, 3, F, G, g, ., and _.

Step 2: Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules

The relevant objects are BABA, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, GOOP, and GOOP. The relevant text blocks are B, 1, 2, 3, F, G, g, ., and _.

The rules in the level are:

* B IS 1: Grants the property 1 to BABA.
* F IS 3: Grants the property 3 to FLAG.
* G IS 2: Grants the property 2 to GOOP.
* g IS YOU: Makes the object goop you control in the game.
* . IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can’t move through it).
* _ IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can’t move through it).

Step 3: Devise a plan to solve the problem

The goal is to move the text blocks and control the objects to make the GOOP object reach the FLAG object. To do this, we need to change the FLAG object into the GOOP object and then move the GOOP object to the FLAG object.

Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules.

The grid level is a 9x9 grid with 101 cells. The grid contains several objects and text blocks. The relevant objects are BABA (B), FLAG (F), ROCK (R), and GOOP (g). The relevant text blocks are IS (1), YOU (2), WIN (3), MELT (9), and SINK (0).

The rules in the level are:

* B IS YOU: BABA is the object you control in the game.
* F IS WIN: The FLAG is the object you need to reach to win the level.
* g IS MELT: The GOOP melts when touched by something marked as HOT.
* R IS SINK: The ROCK destroys itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the level, we need to reach the FLAG and avoid touching the ROCK and GOOP. Since BABA is the object you control, we need to make sure that it doesn't touch the ROCK or GOOP.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

1. Move BABA to the right until it reaches the first row of GOOP.
2. Move BABA up until it reaches the ROCK.
3. Move BABA to the right until it reaches the second row of GOOP.
4. Move BABA up until it reaches the FLAG.

Step 4: Show the answer.

The answer is:

1. Move BABA to the right until it reaches the first row of GOOP.
2. Move BABA up until it reaches the ROCK.
3. Move BABA to the right until it reaches the second row of GOOP.
4. Move BABA up until it reaches the FLAG.

This solution ensures that BABA avoids touching the ROCK and GOOP and reaches the FLAG to win the level.

  Property Text: IS, YOU, WIN, KILL, PUSH, STOP, MOVE, HOT, MELT, SINK
  Active Rules:
  - B IS YOU: BABA is the object you control.
  - F IS WIN: You need to reach the FLAG to win the level.
  - L IS MELT: LAVA melts when touched by something marked as HOT.
  - B IS 1: BABA is in the same group as the object with the number 1.
  - 1 IS PUSH: The object with the number 1 can be pushed.
  - 1 IS MOVE: The object with the number 1 moves one step in its direction every turn.
  - B IS 2: BABA is in the same group as the object with the number 2.
  - 2 IS KILL: The object with the number 2 destroys anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
  - B IS F: BABA is the same object as the FLAG.

2. Devise a plan to solve the problem:
  - Move the BABA to the FLAG.
  - Make sure the BABA doesn’t touch the LAVA.

3. Carry out the plan:
  - Push the object with the number 1 to the right, so it covers the LAVA.
  - Push the object with the number 2 to the right, so it covers the LAVA.
  - Move the BABA to the FLAG.

4. Show the answer:
  The solution is to push the objects with the numbers 1 and 2 to the right, covering the LAVA, and then move the BABA to the FLAG.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Answer:

1. Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules:

Objects: BABA, SKULL, FLAG, ROCK, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE

Text Blocks:
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN
- KEKE IS YOU
- ROCK IS STOP
- WALL IS STOP
- GOOP IS MELT
- LOVE IS HOT
- KEKE IS KILL
- 1 IS MOVE
- 2 IS YOU
- 3 IS WIN
- 6 IS STOP

Rules:
- BABA IS YOU: You control the BABA object.
- FLAG IS WIN: You need to reach the FLAG object to win.
- KEKE IS YOU: You control the KEKE object.
- ROCK IS STOP: The ROCK object is impassable.
- WALL IS STOP: The WALL object is impassable.
- GOOP IS MELT: The GOOP object melts when touched by something marked as HOT.
- LOVE IS HOT: The LOVE object destroys any object marked as MELT when they touch it.
- KEKE IS KILL: The KEKE object destroys anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
- 1 IS MOVE: The BABA object moves one step in its direction every turn.
- 2 IS YOU: The BABA object is controlled.
- 3 IS WIN: The FLAG object is the goal.
- 6 IS STOP: The KEKE object is impassable.

2. Devise a plan to solve the problem:

First, we need to change the rule BABA IS YOU to KEKE IS YOU, so we can control the KEKE object. Then, we need to remove the rule KEKE IS KILL, so the KEKE object doesn’t destroy anything we control. After that, we need to change the rule 2 IS YOU to 1 IS YOU, so the BABA object moves. Finally, we need to move the BABA object to the FLAG object to win.

3. Carry out the plan:

a. Move the text block 2 IS YOU to the right of the text block KEKE IS YOU, forming the rule KEKE IS YOU 2 IS YOU.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_L16....._
_.....f.._
_llllllll_
_........_
_B....b.._
_1......._
_2..F13.._
_........_
__________

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules.

The grid level contains the following objects and text blocks:

Objects:
B = BABA
b = object baba
F = FLAG
f = object flag
L = LAVA
1 = IS
2 = YOU

Text Blocks:
1 IS YOU: Makes the object BABA you control in the game.

Rules:
B IS YOU: Makes the object BABA you control in the game.

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

The goal is to move the BABA object to the object FLAG. To do this, we need to make sure that the BABA object can move through the LAVA objects without being destroyed.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give the intermediate actions.

1. Move the 1 IS YOU text block to the right of the BABA object.
2. Move the 1 IS YOU text block to the right of the LAVA object.
3. Move the 1 IS YOU text block to the right of the FLAG object.
4. Move the BABA object to the right of the FLAG object.

Step 4: Show the answer.

The final grid level should look like this:
__________
_L16....._
_.....f.._
_llllllll_
_........_
_B....b.._
_1......._
_2..F13.._
_........_
__________

The BABA object can now move through the LAVA objects without being destroyed, and the goal is to move the BABA object to the object FLAG.
