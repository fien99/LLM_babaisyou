<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_........_
_.b....f._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

**Current Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** This means you control the Baba object.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** This means reaching the Flag object will win the level.

**Objects in the Grid:**
- B (Baba)
- . (Empty space)
- F (Flag)
- b (another Baba)
- f (Flag)

**Text Blocks:**
- 1 (IS)
- 2 (YOU)
- 3 (WIN)
- 4 (KILL)
- 5 (PUSH)
- 6 (STOP)
- 7 (MOVE)
- 8 (HOT)
- 9 (MELT)
- 0 (SINK)

**Border and Empty Spaces:**
- _ (Border)
- . (Empty space)

**Analysis and Plan:**

1. **Objective:** Move Baba (B) to the Flag (F) to win.
2. **Current State:** 
   - Baba (B) is controllable.
   - Flag (F) is the winning condition.
   - No direct path to Flag (F).

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move Baba (B) to the right to clear the path:**
   - Move B to the right to position B at _b....f._

2. **Create a path for Baba (B) to reach Flag (F):**
   - Use the text block "5 PUSH" to push the Rock (R) to create a path.
   - Move the "5 PUSH" text block to a position where it can push the Rock (R).

3. **Ensure Baba (B) can move freely:**
   - Use the text block "6 STOP" to make the second Baba (b) immovable.
   - Place "6 STOP" on b to stop it from blocking the path.

4. **Move Baba (B) to the Flag (F):**
   - With the path cleared, move Baba (B) to the Flag (F) to win.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Move Baba (B) to the right:**
   - Move B to _b....f._

2. **Move "5 PUSH" to push Rock (R):**
   - Move "5 PUSH" to _b....f_ (positioned to push R).

3. **Use "6 STOP" on the second Baba (b):**
   - Move "6 STOP" to b to make it immovable.

4. **Push Rock (R) to clear the path:**
   - Use "5 PUSH" to push R to the right.

5. **Move Baba (B) to the Flag (F):**
   - Move B to F to win.

**Final Grid:**
__________
_B12..F13_
_........._
_........._
_........._
_.b....f._
_........._
_........._
_........._
__________
F

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is to move Baba (B) to the Flag (F) to win. I hope it is correct.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12...13_
_........_
_........_
_.....F.._
_.b....f._

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

**Grid Analysis:**
- The grid is 10x10.
- There is a Baba (b) at position (3, 5).
- There is a Flag (f) at position (8, 5).
- There are Baba text blocks (B) at positions (2, 7), (3, 8), and (4, 8).
- There is a Flag text block (F) at position (7, 8).
- There are empty spaces (.) and borders (_).

**Current Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU**: This means you control the Baba object.

**Objective:**
- **WIN**: Reach the Flag (f) to win the level.

**Plan:**
1. **Move Baba (b) to the Flag (f)**:
   - First, we need to clear a path for Baba to reach the Flag.
   - We can use Baba's ability to push blocks to create a path.

2. **Clear Path:**
   - Move Baba (b) to push the Rock (r) at (4, 6) down.
   - Push the Rock (r) to (3, 6) to clear a path.

3. **Move Baba to Flag:**
   - Move Baba (b) to (3, 6) after pushing the Rock.
   - From (3, 6), move Baba (b) to (4, 6).
   - From (4, 6), move Baba (b) to (5, 6).
   - From (5, 6), move Baba (b) to (6, 6).
   - From (6, 6), move Baba (b) to (7, 6).
   - From (7, 6), move Baba (b) to (8, 6).
   - Finally, move Baba (b) to (8, 5) to reach the Flag (f).

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move Baba (b) to (4, 6):**
   - Move_to[ b, 4, 6 ]

2. **Push Rock (r) to (3, 6):**
   - Push[ r, 3, 6 ]

3. **Move Baba (b) to (3, 6):**
   - Move_to[ b, 3, 6 ]

4. **Move Baba (b) to (4, 6):**
   - Move_to[ b, 4, 6 ]

5. **Move Baba (b) to (5, 6):**
   - Move_to[ b, 5, 6 ]

6. **Move Baba (b) to (6, 6):**
   - Move_to[ b, 6, 6 ]

7. **Move Baba (b) to (7, 6):**
   - Move_to[ b, 7, 6 ]

8. **Move Baba (b) to (8, 6):**
   - Move_to[ b, 8, 6 ]

9. **Move Baba (b) to (8, 5):**
   - Move_to[ b, 8, 5 ]

**Final Action:**

- Move_to[ b, 8, 5 ]

**Solution:**

By following the plan and executing the intermediate actions, Baba (b) will reach the Flag (f) at position (8, 5) to win the level.

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is to move Baba (b) to (8, 5). I hope it is correct.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

**Grid Analysis:**
- **Objects:** B (Baba), 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), b (Baba)
- **Property Text:** 12 (IS WIN), 7 (MOVE)

**Current Active Rules:**
- **Baba IS YOU:** Baba is controllable by the player.
- **Baba IS MOVE:** Baba moves one step in its direction every turn.

**Objective:**
Reach the WIN block to win the level.

**Plan:**
1. **Move Baba to the WIN block:** Since Baba is controllable and can move, the primary goal is to navigate Baba to the WIN block.
2. **Utilize the MOVE property:** Baba can move one step per turn, so we need to plan a path efficiently.
3. **Avoid obstacles:** Use the PUSH action to move blocks if necessary.

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move Baba to the right:** Move Baba from its starting position to the right, avoiding the B12 block.
   ```
   _........_
   _...B..._
   _........_
   _.1......_
   _.3..b..._
   _........_
   _........_
   _........_
   _________
   ```

2. **Push the 1 block:** Move the 1 block down to create a path for Baba to reach the WIN block.
   ```
   _........_
   _...B..._
   _........_
   _.1......_
   _.3..b..._
   _........_
   1.........
   _........_
   _________
   ```

3. **Move Baba down:** Now that the path is clear, move Baba down to reach the WIN block.
   ```
   _........_
   _...B..._
   _........_
   _.1......_
   _.3..b..._
   1.........
   _........_
   b.........
   _________
   ```

4. **Move Baba to WIN:** Move Baba to the WIN block to win the level.
   ```
   _........_
   _...B..._
   _........_
   _.1......_
   _.3..b..._
   1.........
   _........_
   bWIN....
   _________
   ```

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is to move Baba to the WIN block, following the steps outlined above. The exact sequence of moves is:

1. Move Baba right.
2. Push the 1 block down.
3. Move Baba down.
4. Move Baba to WIN.

The final grid should look like this:

```
_........_
_...B..._
_........_
_.1......_
_.3..b..._
1.........
_........_
bWIN....

The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_...R...._
_........_
_......1F_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

**Current Active Rules:**
- **BABA IS YOU:** This means you control the Baba object.
- **FLAG IS WIN:** This means reaching the Flag object will win the level.

**Objects Present:**
- B (Baba)
- R (Rock)
- . (Empty space)
- F (Flag, the winning condition)
- b (Baba, controlled by the player)
- r (Rock)

**Text Blocks Present:**
- 1 (IS)
- F (FLAG)
- B (BABA)

**Border and Empty Spaces:**
- _ (Border)
- . (Empty space)

**Initial Analysis:**
- **Objective:** Move the Baba (controlled by the player) to the Flag to win.
- **Challenges:**
  - The Flag is surrounded by rocks, which are immovable.
  - Baba cannot directly move to the Flag.

**Plan:**
1. **Make Baba movable:** Ensure Baba has the "MOVE" property.
2. **Clear a path to the Flag:** Move or destroy obstacles in the way.
3. **Move Baba to the Flag:** Once a clear path is available, move Baba to the Flag.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1: Make Baba movable**
- **Action:** Move the text block "MOVE" to align with "BABA" to form "BABA IS MOVE".
- **Intermediate State:**
  ```
  _B12..F13_
  _........_
  _........_
  _.b....r._
  _........_
  _...R...._
  _........_
  _......1F_
  ```
  **Active Rules:** BABA IS YOU, BABA IS MOVE

**Step 2: Clear a path to the Flag**
- **Action:** Use Baba to push the Rock (r) to clear a path.
- **Intermediate State:**
  ```
  _B12..F13_
  _r........_
  _........_
  _.b....F._
  _........_
  _...R...._
  _........_
  _......1F_
  ```
  **Active Rules:** BABA IS YOU, BABA IS MOVE, BABA IS PUSH

- **Action:** Now, push the Rock (r) again to clear another path.
- **Intermediate State:**
  ```
  _B12..F13_
  _r........_
  _........_
  _.b...F._
  _........_
  _...R...._
  _........_
  _......1F_
  ```
  **Active Rules:** BABA IS YOU, BABA IS MOVE, BABA IS PUSH

**Step 3: Move Baba to the Flag**
- **Action:** Move Baba (b) to the Flag (F).
- **Intermediate State:**
  ```
  _B12F13_
  _r........_
  _........_
  _.b...F._
  _........_
  _...R...._
  _........_
  _......1F_
  ```
  **Active Rules:** BABA IS YOU, BABA IS WIN

- **Action:** Win by reaching the Flag.
- **Final State:**
  ```
  _B12F13_
  _r........_
  _........_
  _.b...F._
  _........_
  _...R...._
  _........_
  _......1F_
  ```
  **Active Rules:** BABA IS WIN

**Final Answer:** The final answer is to move Baba to the Flag to win the level. I hope it is correct.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:

_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_.R1R...._

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, ROCK IS ROCK and ROCK IS FLAG.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

1. **Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - BABA (b)

   - FLOOR (o)
   - ROCK (r)
   - WALL (w)
   - KEKE (k)
   - GOOP (g)
   - LOVE (v)
   - Empty spaces (.)

2. **Current Active Rules:**
   - BABA IS YOU: You control the Baba object.
   - FLAG IS WIN: The FLAG is the winning condition.
   - ROCK IS ROCK: This rule is redundant since it just confirms that ROCK remains ROCK.
   - ROCK IS FLAG: This rule indicates that ROCK can be transformed into FLAG.

3. **Goal:**
   - Move the Baba (b) to the FLAG (f) to win the level.

**Plan:**

1. **Change ROCK IS FLAG to ROCK IS WIN:** This will make ROCK the winning condition instead of FLAG.
2. **Move the ROCK (r) to a position where Baba (b) can reach it.**
3. **Move Baba (b) to the ROCK (r) to win the level.**

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move the ROCK (r) to the right:**
   - Move_To[r, RRR]

2. **Change the rule ROCK IS FLAG to ROCK IS WIN:**
   - Make_Rule[r, IS, WIN]

3. **Move Baba (b) to the ROCK (r):**
   - Move_To[b, RRR]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Move the ROCK (r) to the right:**

__________
_K......._
_1k.B..12_
_7......._
_........_

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

**Objects:**
- K: KEKE
- b: BABA
- f: FLAG
- .: Empty space
- : Border

**Text Blocks:**
- 1: IS
- 2: YOU
- 3: WIN
- 7: MOVE

**Active Rules:**
- KEKE IS MOVE: This means KEKE can move.
- FLAG IS WIN: This means reaching the FLAG is the winning condition.

**Analysis:**
- KEKE can move, but it needs a path to reach the FLAG.
- The FLAG is the WIN condition, so we need to move KEKE to the FLAG.

**Plan:**
1. **Make KEKE movable:** KEKE already has the MOVE rule, so it can move.
2. **Clear a path for KEKE:** We need to remove obstacles so KEKE can reach the FLAG.
3. **Move KEKE to the FLAG:** Once a path is clear, move KEKE to the FLAG.

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move KEKE:** Since KEKE IS MOVE, we can immediately move it.
   - Move KEKE to the right: K...b.f... -> ...b.f...

2. **Clear the path:**
   - Push the BABA (b) down to clear a path for KEKE.
   - Move BABA down: ..b.f... -> .b.f...

3. **Move KEKE:** Now that BABA is moved, KEKE can proceed.
   - Move KEKE down: .b.f... -> b.f...

4. **Clear the path further:**
   - Push the FLAG (f) to the right to clear a path for KEKE.
   - Move FLAG right: b.f... -> .f...

5. **Move KEKE:** KEKE can now move to the FLAG.
   - Move KEKE right: .f... -> F...

6. **Win:** KEKE reaches the FLAG.

**Final Answer:**

After executing the above steps, KEKE reaches the FLAG, satisfying the condition FLAG IS WIN.

Final Answer: The final answer is FLAG. I hope it is correct.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

**Objects:**
- `b` = Baba (you)
- `f` = Flag (Win)
- `w` = Wall
- `.` = Empty space
- `B12` = Baba text block
- `F13` = Flag text block

**Property Text Blocks:**
- `1` = IS
- `2` = YOU
- `3` = WIN
- `6` = PUSH

**Current Active Rules:**
- `BABA IS YOU`: Baba is controllable by the player.
- `FLAG IS WIN`: The Flag is the winning condition.
- `WALL IS STOP`: Walls are impassable.

**Initial Analysis:**
- To win, Baba must reach the Flag.
- Walls block direct paths, so we need to find an alternative route.
- Baba can push objects and text blocks to clear the path.

**Plan:**
1. **Move Baba to the right:** Clear the path by pushing objects.
2. **Create a path to the Flag:** Use text blocks to form new rules if necessary.
3. **Move Baba to the Flag:** Reach and touch the Flag to win.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1: Move Baba to the right**

- Move Baba (B) to the right to `._.b..._`

**Step 2: Push the Wall**

- Push the Wall (w) down to clear the path: `._.b...w_`

**Step 3: Move Baba to the right**

- Move Baba to `._.bw..._`

**Step 4: Push the Wall**

- Push the Wall (w) down again: `._.b.w..._`

**Step 5: Move Baba to the right**

- Move Baba to `._.b.w.._`

**Step 6: Push the Wall**

- Push the Wall (w) down: `._.b.w...`

**Step 7: Move Baba to the right**

- Move Baba to `._.b.w..f`

**Step 8: Push the Flag**

- Push the Flag (F) to the right: `._.b.w.f_`

**Step 9: Move Baba to the Flag**

- Move Baba (B) to the Flag (F) to win: `._.B.F_`

**Final Action:**

- Move Baba to touch the Flag to win.

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is to move Baba to touch the Flag. I hope it is correct.

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_........_
_S14....._
_....sss._
_.b..sfs._
_....sss._
_........_
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and SKULL IS KILL.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

1. **Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - BABA (b), SKULL (s), FLAG (f), FLOOR (o), GRASS (a), LAVA (l), ROCK (r), WALL (w), KEKE (k), GOOP (g), LOVE (v)
   - Text blocks: B, S, F, O, A, L, R, W, K, G, V, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0

2. **Active Rules:**
   - BABA IS YOU: You control BABA.
   - FLAG IS WIN: You need to reach the FLAG to win.
   - SKULL IS KILL: The SKULL kills anything it touches.

**Objective:**
Reach the FLAG to win.

**Analysis:**
- **Current State:**
  - BABA is at the bottom right.
  - SKULL is at the top left.
  - FLAG is at the top right.
  - BABA needs to move to the top right to win.

- **Challenges:**
  - SKULL is in the way and will kill BABA if touched.
  - Direct path to FLAG is blocked by SKULL.

**Plan:**
1. **Neutralize SKULL:** We need to either move SKULL away or make it safe.
2. **Create a Path:** Clear a path for BABA to reach FLAG.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Neutralize SKULL:**
   - We cannot directly push SKULL because it will kill BABA.
   - We need to use text blocks to change SKULL's properties.
   - **Make Rule:** SKULL IS STOP. This will make SKULL impassable and safe for BABA.

2. **Create a Path:**
   - Move BABA to a position where it can push objects to clear a path.
   - **Move BABA:** Move BABA to the left to avoid SKULL.
   - **Push FLOOR:** Push FLOORs to create a bridge over LAVA.

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move BABA to the left:**
   - Move BABA to the left to avoid SKULL.
   ```
   _........_
   _....sss._
   _.b..sfs._
   _....sss._
   _........_
   _........_
   _B12..F13_
   _________
   ```

2. **Push FLOORs:**
   - Push the FLOORs to create a path over LAVA.
   ```
   _........_
   _....sss._
   _.b..sfs._
   _....oos._
   _........_
   _........_
   _B12..F13_
   _________
   ```
   - Ensure BABA can now move up and right to reach FLAG.

3. **Move BABA to the FLAG:**
   - Move BABA up and then right to reach FLAG.
   ```
   _........_
   _....sss._
   _.b..sfs._
   _....oos._
   _....sss._
   _........_
   _F........_
   _________
   ```

**Final State:**
- BABA reaches the FLAG, winning the level.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is to move BABA to the FLAG by first moving it left to avoid SKULL, pushing FLOORs to create a path over LAVA, and then moving BABA up and right to reach the FLAG. I hope it is correct.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:

The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, LAVA IS HOT and BABA IS MELT.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

**Objects:**
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)
- LAVA (l)
- FLOOR (o)
- WALL (w)
- ROCK (r)
- KEKE (k)
- GOOP (g)
- LOVE (v)

**Text Blocks:**
- 1 = IS
- 2 = YOU
- 3 = WIN
- 8 = HOT
- 9 = MELT

**Active Rules:**
1. BABA IS YOU: You control BABA.
2. FLAG IS WIN: FLAG is the winning condition.
3. LAVA IS HOT: LAVA is HOT.
4. BABA IS MELT: BABA melts when touched by something HOT.

**Goal:**
Reach FLAG to win the level.

**Analysis:**
- BABA is YOU and can move.
- LAVA is HOT and can melt BABA if they touch.
- BABA IS MELT means BABA will self-destruct if it touches LAVA.
- FLAG IS WIN means reaching FLAG wins the game.

**Plan:**
1. Move BABA away from LAVA to avoid being melted.
2. Use BABA to push or manipulate objects to reach FLAG.
3. Ensure BABA does not touch LAVA again after moving away.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Move BABA to safety:**
   - Move BABA to the right to avoid LAVA.
   ```
   _...f...._
   _........_
   _llllllll_
   _L.....B._
   _1...b.1._
   _8.....9._
   _........_
   _........_
   _B12..F13_
   ```

2. **Clear path to FLAG:**
   - Push the ROCK (r) to the right to create a path.
   ```
   _...f...._
   _........_
   _llllllll_
   _L.....B._
   _1...b.r1._
   _8.....9._
   _........_
   _........_
   _B12..F13_
   ```
   
3. **Move BABA towards FLAG:**
   - Move BABA up and then left to reach FLAG.
   ```
   _...f...._
   _........_
   _llllllll_
   _L.....B._
   _1...b.r1._
   _8.....9._
   _........_
   _........_
   _B..F13_
   ```

4. **Reach FLAG:**
   - Move BABA to the FLAG to win the game.
   ```
   _...f...._
   _........_
   _llllllll_
   _L.....B._
   _1...b.r1._
   _8.....9._
   _........_
   _........_
   _B.F13_
   ```

**Final Answer:**
Move BABA to F13 to win the game.

**Explanation:**
- Initially, BABA was in danger of being melted by LAVA.
- We moved BABA away from LAVA to ensure its safety.
- We cleared a path by pushing the ROCK.
- Finally, we moved BABA directly to the FLAG to win the game.

This step-by-step approach ensures that BABA reaches the FLAG without being destroyed by LAVA, adhering to the game's rules and constraints.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

- 4 (KILL)
- 5 (PUSH)
- 6 (STOP)
- 7 (MOVE)
- 8 (HOT)
- 9 (MELT)
- 0 (SINK)

**Active Rules:**
- BABA IS YOU: You control BABA.
- FLAG IS WIN: FLAG is the winning condition.
- WALL IS STOP: WALLs are impassable.

**Goal:**
Reach FLAG to win.

**Analysis:**
1. **Control BABA:** Since BABA IS YOU, you can move BABA.
2. **Objective:** Move BABA to FLAG.
3. **Obstacles:**
   - WALLs are impassable.
   - FLOOR (o) and LOVE (v) are objects that can be pushed or interacted with.

**Plan:**
1. **Move BABA around the WALLs.**
2. **Push any obstacles out of the way.**
3. **Direct BABA to FLAG.**

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move BABA to the right:**
   - Move BABA to the right to avoid the WALL.
   - Action: Move_To [B, 1]

2. **Push the FLOOR (o) down:**
   - Move BABA below the FLOOR.
   - Push FLOOR down to clear the path.
   - Action: Push [FLOOR, DOWN]

3. **Move BABA to the right again:**
   - Move BABA to the right to avoid the WALL.
   - Action: Move_To [B, 2]

4. **Push the LOVE (v) to the right:**
   - Move BABA below LOVE.
   - Push LOVE to clear the path.
   - Action: Push [LOVE, RIGHT]

5. **Move BABA to the right and then down:**
   - Move BABA to the right to avoid the WALL.
   - Move BABA down to reach the FLAG.
   - Action: Move_To [B, 3] then Move_To [B, 4]

6. **Reach FLAG:**
   - Move BABA to the FLAG to win.
   - Action: Move_To [B, 5]

**Solution:**

1. Move BABA to the right: Move_To [B, 1]
2. Push FLOOR down: Push [FLOOR, DOWN]
3. Move BABA to the right again: Move_To [B, 2]
4. Push LOVE to the right: Push [LOVE, RIGHT]
5. Move BABA down to FLAG: Move_To [B, 3] then Move_To [B, 4]
6. Move BABA to FLAG: Move_To [B, 5]

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is Move BABA to the coordinates (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (5, 2). I hope it is correct.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and LAVA IS STOP.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the grid and the current active rules:

1. **Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - BABA (b), FLAG (f), LAVA (l), FLOOR (o), WALL (w), and empty spaces (.).
   - Text blocks: 1 (IS), 2 (YOU), 3 (WIN), 13 (MOVE), and other unused property texts.

2. **Active Rules:**
   - **BABA IS YOU:** This means you control the BABA object.
   - **FLAG IS WIN:** The FLAG is the winning condition; you need to reach it.
   - **LAVA IS STOP:** LAVA blocks are impassable.

**Objective:**
Reach the FLAG (WIN) by manipulating the rules and moving objects.

**Plan:**

1. **Move BABA to clear a path to the FLAG:**
   - Since BABA IS YOU, we can move BABA around.
   - First, we need to clear the LAVA (l) blocking our path to the FLAG.

2. **Change LAVA's property:**
   - We need to remove LAVA IS STOP to make it movable.
   - We can use the text block "1" (IS) to change the rule.

3. **Move BABA to the LAVA:**
   - Once LAVA is no longer STOP, we can push it out of the way.

4. **Create a path to the FLAG:**
   - Move BABA to clear any other obstacles.

5. **Move BABA to the FLAG:**
   - Once a clear path is established, move BABA to the FLAG to win.

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move BABA to the "1" (IS) text block:**
   - Move BABA to the left to reach the "1" text block.

2. **Change LAVA IS STOP to LAVA IS MOVE:**
   - Push the "1" (IS) text block to align with "LAVA" and "MOVE" to form "LAVA IS MOVE".
   - Now LAVA can be moved.

3. **Move LAVA out of the way:**
   - Push LAVA to the right to clear the path.

4. **Move BABA to clear any other obstacles:**
   - Move BABA to push any remaining FLOOR (o) or WALL (w) blocks out of the way.

5. **Move BABA to the FLAG:**
   - Once a clear path is established, move BABA to the FLAG to win.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Move BABA to the "1" (IS) text block:**
   - Move BABA to the left to reach the "1" text block.

2. **Change LAVA IS STOP to LAVA IS MOVE:**
   - Push the "1" (IS) text block to align with "LAVA" and "MOVE" to form "LAVA IS MOVE".
   - Now LAVA can be moved.

3. **Move LAVA out of the way:**
   - Push LAVA to the right to clear the path.

4. **Move BABA to clear any other obstacles:**
   - Move BABA to push any remaining FLOOR (o) or WALL (w) blocks out of the way.

5. **Move BABA to the FLAG:**
   - Once a clear path is established, move BABA to the FLAG to win.

**Final Answer:**

After executing the above steps, BABA reaches the FLAG, and the level is solved.

Final Answer: The final answer is FLAG. I hope it is correct.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In the given level, the objects are:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)

The text blocks are:
- B12 (12 is a property text)
- ... (empty space)
- 13 (13 is a property text)

The active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU (You control the BABA)

The goal is to move the BABA to the FLAG (F) to win the level.

First, let's understand the properties 12 and 13:
- 12 is the property "IS"
- 13 is the property "WIN"

Since the BABA is controlled by the rule "BABA IS YOU", we can move the BABA to the FLAG (F) by following these steps:

1. Move the BABA to the position of the FLAG (F) using the Move_To[F] action.
2. Create the rule "F IS WIN" using the Make_Rule[F, WIN] action.
3. Move the BABA to the FLAG (F) again using the Move_To[F] action.
4. The BABA will now be the "WIN" object, and the level is won.

Here's the solution in action:

1. Move_To[B, F]
2. Make_Rule[F, WIN]
3. Move_To[B, F]
4. The level is won.

The final active rules will be:
- BABA IS YOU
- F IS WIN

And the BABA will be the "WIN" object, and the level is won.

2. Make the BABA pushable.
3. Push the BABA to the flag (f).
4. Make the BABA stoppable.
5. Move the BABA to the flag (f).

Intermediate Actions:
1. Move_To B12 -> Move the BABA to the position of the flag (f).
2. Make_Rule B12 PUSH: Make the BABA pushable.
3. Push B12 f: Push the BABA to the flag (f).
4. Make_Rule B12 STOP: Make the BABA stoppable.
5. Move_To B12 f: Move the BABA to the flag (f).

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In the given level, the relevant objects are:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)
- ROCK (r)

The relevant text blocks are:
- B12 (BABA IS)
- F13 (FLAG IS WIN)
- 1 (IS)

The active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU (You control the BABA)
- FLAG IS WIN (The goal is to reach the FLAG)
- ROCK IS ROCK (The rocks are immovable)
- ROCK IS FLAG (The rocks are also flags)

The goal is to move the BABA to the FLAG.

Plan:
1. Move the BABA to the top-left rock (r) to make it mutable.
2. Make the top-left rock (r) a BABA.
3. Move the BABA to the FLAG.

Intermediate Actions:
1. Move_To(BABA, r)
2. Brake_Rule(ROCK IS ROCK)
3. Make_Rule(r IS BABA)
4. Move_To(BABA, f)

Answer:
1. Move_To(BABA, r)
2. Brake_Rule(ROCK IS ROCK)
3. Make_Rule(r IS BABA)
4. Move_To(BABA, f)

The BABA will now be a rock and will be able to move to the FLAG, making it win the level.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

In the given level, the relevant objects are:
- BABA (b)
- SKULL (s)
- FLAG (f)

The relevant text blocks are:
- S14 (property 14 for skull)
- b (object baba)
- s (object skull)
- f (object flag)

The active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU (You control the baba)
- FLAG IS WIN (The flag is the win condition)
- SKULL IS KILL (The skull kills anything you control)

The goal is to move the flag to the exit (position B12) without getting killed by the skull.

Plan:
1. Move the baba to the position of the skull (s) using Move_To[b, s].
2. Change the skull into the baba using Make_Rule[s IS b].
3. Move the baba to the position of the flag (f) using Move_To[b, f].
4. Change the flag into the baba using Make_Rule[f IS b].
5. Move the baba to the exit (B12) using Move_To[b, B12].

Intermediate actions:
1. Move the baba to the position of the skull using Move_To[b, s].
2. Break the rule SKULL IS KILL using Brake_Rule[SKULL IS KILL].
3. Move the baba to the position of the skull again using Move_To[b, s].
4. Change the skull into the baba using Make_Rule[s IS b].
5. Move the baba to the position of the flag using Move_To[b, f].
6. Break the rule FLAG IS WIN using Brake_Rule[FLAG IS WIN].
7. Move the baba to the position of the flag again using Move_To[b, f].
8. Change the flag into the baba using Make_Rule[f IS b].
9. Move the baba to the exit using Move_To[b, B12].

Answer:
The solution is a sequence of actions:
1. Move_To[b, s]
2. Brake_Rule[SKULL IS KILL]
3. Move_To[b, s]
4. Make_Rule[s IS b]
5. Move_To[b, f]
6. Brake_Rule[FLAG IS WIN]
7. Move_To[b, f]
8. Make_Rule[f IS b]
9. Move_To[b, B12]

The final grid after executing the solution will have the flag at the exit (B12).

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another.

_B12..F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, LAVA IS HOT and BABA IS MELT.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In the given level, the relevant objects are:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)
- LAVA (l)
- BABA (b)

The relevant text blocks are:
- 1 (property text)
- f (object text)
- b (object text)
- l (object text)

The active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN
- LAVA IS HOT
- BABA IS MELT

The goal is to move the BABA to the flag (f) to win the level.

Plan:
1. Move the BABA to the leftmost B (b) using Move_To[BABA, b].
2. Change the BABA into a LAVA using Make_Rule[BABA IS LAVA].
3. Move the LAVA to the rightmost L (l) using Move_To[LAVA, l].
4. Change the LAVA into a BABA using Make_Rule[LAVA IS BABA].
5. Move the BABA to the flag (f) using Move_To[BABA, f].

Intermediate actions:
1. Move the BABA to the leftmost B (b) using Move_To[BABA, b].
- Push the BABA towards the leftmost B (b) using Push[BABA, b].
- Move the BABA to the leftmost B (b) using Move_To[BABA, b].

2. Change the BABA into a LAVA using Make_Rule[BABA IS LAVA].
- Move the text block 1 to the top of the grid using Move_To[1, _].
- Move the text block b to the top of the grid using Move_To[b, _].
- Create the rule BABA IS LAVA using Make_Rule[BABA IS LAVA].

3. Move the LAVA to the rightmost L (l) using Move_To[LAVA, l].
- Push the LAVA towards the rightmost L (l) using Push[LAVA, l].
- Move the LAVA to the rightmost L (l) using Move_To[LAVA, l].

4. Change the LAVA into a BABA using Make_Rule[LAVA IS BABA].
- Move the text block 1 to the top of the grid using Move_To[1, _].
- Move the text block l to the top of the grid using Move_To[l, _].
- Create the rule LAVA IS BABA using Make_Rule[LAVA IS BABA].

5. Move the BABA to the flag (f) using Move_To[BABA, f].
- Push the BABA towards the flag (f) using Push[BABA, f].
- Move the BABA to the flag (f) using Move_To[BABA, f].

Answer:
The solution is to perform the following actions:
1. Move the BABA to the leftmost B (b) using Move_To[BABA, b].
2. Change the BABA into a LAVA using Make_Rule[BABA IS LAVA].
3. Move the LAVA to the rightmost L (l) using Move_To[LAVA, l].
4. Change the LAVA into a BABA using Make_Rule[LAVA IS BABA].
5. Move the BABA to the flag (f) using Move_To[BABA, f].

The final grid after the solution is:
__________
_...f...._
_........_
_llllllll_
_L.....B._
_1...b.1._
_8.....9._
_........_
_B12..F13_
__________

The BABA is now at the flag (f), and the level is won.

_........_
_..k..f.._
_wwwwwwww_
_.......W_
_..K..b.1_
_.......6_
_B12....._
_.....F13_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and WALL IS STOP.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In the given level, the relevant objects are:
- BABA (b)
- SKULL (k)
- FLAG (f)
- WALL (w)
- KEKE (k)

The relevant text blocks are:
- <object_text>: b, k, f, w
- <property_text>: 1, 2, 6

The active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN
- WALL IS STOP

The goal is to move the BABA to the flag (f) to win the level.

Plan:
1. Move the BABA to the KEKE (k) using the rule BABA IS YOU.
2. Change the KEKE into the BABA using the rule KEKE IS BABA.
3. Move the BABA to the SKULL (k) using the rule BABA IS YOU.
4. Change the SKULL into the BABA using the rule SKULL IS BABA.
5. Move the BABA to the FLAG (f) using the rule BABA IS YOU.
6. Change the FLAG into the BABA using the rule FLAG IS BABA.
7. Move the BABA to the WIN position (1) using the rule BABA IS YOU.

Intermediate Actions:
1. Move_To(b, k)
2. Make_Rule(KEKE IS BABA)
3. Move_To(b, k)
4. Make_Rule(SKULL IS BABA)
5. Move_To(b, f)
6. Make_Rule(FLAG IS BABA)
7. Move_To(b, 1)
8. Make_Rule(BABA IS WIN)

Solution:
The solution is a sequence of actions that lead to the goal. The sequence of actions is:
1. Move_To(b, k)
2. Make_Rule(KEKE IS BABA)
3. Move_To(b, k)
4. Make_Rule(SKULL IS BABA)
5. Move_To(b, f)
6. Make_Rule(FLAG IS BABA)
7. Move_To(b, 1)
8. Make_Rule(BABA IS WIN)

The final active rules will be: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS BABA, KEKE IS BABA, SKULL IS BABA, WALL IS STOP, and BABA IS WIN. The BABA will be at the position (1) and the level will be won.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules.

Objects:
BABA, FLOOR, GRASS, WALL, SKULL

Text Blocks:
1, 2, 3

Rules:
BABA IS YOU

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

1. Make BABA IS YOU to BABA IS MOVE.
2. Move BABA to the position of the SKULL.
3. Make SKULL IS YOU.
4. Move SKULL to the position of the FLOOR.
5. Make FLOOR IS WIN.
6. Move SKULL to the position of the GRASS.
7. Make GRASS IS YOU.
8. Move GRASS to the position of the FLOOR.
9. Make FLOOR IS WIN.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

Action 1: Make_Rule[BABA, IS, MOVE]

Action 2: Move_To[BABA, SKULL]

Action 3: Make_Rule[SKULL, IS, YOU]

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules.

Objects:
BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE

Text Blocks:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0

Rules:
KEKE IS MOVE
FLAG IS WIN

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

1. Move the BABA object to the FLAG object.
2. Make the BABA object the player-controlled object.
3. Make the SKULL object the player-controlled object.
4. Move the SKULL object to the GOOP object.
5. Make the GOOP object the player-controlled object.
6. Move the GOOP object to the BABA object.
7. Make the BABA object the player-controlled object.
8. Move the BABA object to the FLAG object.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

1. Move_To[BABA, f]
2. Make_Rule[BABA IS YOU]
3. Make_Rule[SKULL IS YOU]
4. Move_To[SKULL, g]
5. Make_Rule[GOOP IS YOU]
6. Move_To[GOOP, BABA]
7. Make_Rule[BABA IS YOU]
8. Move_To[BABA, F]

The final answer is:

1. Move_To[BABA, f]
2. Make\_Rule[BABA IS YOU]
3. Make\_Rule[SKULL IS YOU]
4. Move\_To[SKULL, g]
5. Make\_Rule[GOOP IS YOU]
6. Move\_To[GOOP, BABA]
7. Make\_Rule[BABA IS YOU]
8. Move\_To[BABA, F]

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,

    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

A solution exist of one or more actions. An action can be one of the following:
Move_To[ ]:
The player-controlled object moves to a valid target in the grid:
<object>, <object_text>, or <property_text>.
This action is valid only if the specified target is present in the grid.

Brake_Rule[ ]:
Removes an active rule unless it’s at the border. Effects depend on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Removes the property from the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: No changes occur.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes the object mutable.

Make_Rule[ ]:
Creates a new rule using valid text blocks in the grid, with effects depending on the rule:
[<object_text> IS <property_text>]: Grants a property to the object.
[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, LAVA IS HOT and BABA IS MELT.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules.

Objects:
BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, LAVA, ROCK, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE

Text Blocks:
<object_text>:
B, F, L, 1, 8, 9, B

<property_text>:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0

Active Rules:
BABA IS YOU
FLAG IS WIN
LAVA IS HOT
BABA IS MELT

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

1. Make the BABA object not melt.
2. Make the BABA object pushable.
3. Move the BABA object to the FLAG.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.

[<object1_text> IS <object2_text>]: Transforms <object1> into <object2>.
[<object1_text> IS <object1_text>]: Makes <object1> immutable.
This action requires all components of the rule to be present in the grid.

Push[ ]:
The player-controlled object pushes another object or text block in the grid. Effects depend on what is pushed:
Text blocks <object_text>, <property_text>: Can be pushed to arrange or create rules.
Objects <object>: Can be pushed towards other objects if the pushed object is set to "push."
This action is valid only if all elements are present in the grid and not placed at the border.

__________
_L16....._
_.....f.._
_llllllll_
_........_
_B....b.._
_1......._
_2..F13.._
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and LAVA IS STOP.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules.

Objects:
BABA, LAVA, FLAG, FLOOR, GOOP, WALL, ROCK, and KEKE.

Text Blocks:
1, 2, BABA, FLAG, LAVA, FLOOR, GOOP, WALL, ROCK, and KEKE.

Active Rules:
BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, and LAVA IS STOP.

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

1. Move BABA to the FLAG.
2. Make sure BABA doesn't melt in the LAVA.
3. Make sure BABA can push the ROCK.
4. Make sure BABA can push the GOOP.
5. Make sure BABA can push the WALL.
6. Make sure BABA can push the KEKE.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

Action 1: Move_To[BABA, FLAG]
Action 2: Brake_Rule[LAVA IS STOP]
Action 3: Make_Rule[BABA IS PUSH]
Action 4: Make_Rule[ROCK IS PUSH]
Action 5: Make_Rule[GOOP IS PUSH]
Action 6: Make_Rule[WALL IS PUSH]
Action 7: Make_Rule[KEKE IS PUSH]

Step 4: Solve the problem step by step and show the answer.

Action 1: Move_To[BABA, FLAG]
- Move BABA to the FLAG.

Action 2: Brake_Rule[LAVA IS STOP]
- Remove the LAVA IS STOP rule.

Action 3: Make_Rule[BABA IS PUSH]
- Make BABA pushable.

Action 4: Make_Rule[ROCK IS PUSH]
- Make ROCK pushable.

Action 5: Make_Rule[GOOP IS PUSH]
- Make GOOP pushable.

Action 6: Make_Rule[WALL IS PUSH]
- Make WALL pushable.

Action 7: Make_Rule[KEKE IS PUSH]
- Make KEKE pushable.

Now, BABA can move through the LAVA, push the ROCK, GOOP, WALL, and KEKE, and reach the FLAG. The problem is solved.
