<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,

    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.

_.b....f._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Grid and Initial Rules:**
   - The grid is 10x10.
   - Initial active rules: 
     - BABA IS YOU: Baba is the controllable object.
     - FLAG IS WIN: The flag is the winning condition.

2. **Identify Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - Text Blocks:
     - B = BABA
     - F = FLAG
   - Objects:
     - b = Baba (you)
     - f = Flag (winning condition)

3. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - Baba starts at the bottom right corner.
   - The flag is at the top left corner.
   - There are obstacles and empty spaces in between.

4. **Plan:**
   - Move Baba to the flag.
   - Use the PUSH rule to move obstacles if necessary.

5. **Intermediate Actions:**
   - **Step 1:** Move Baba up from the bottom right corner.
     - Move Baba up to the first row.
   - **Step 2:** Move Baba right to the second column.
     - Move Baba right to the second column.
   - **Step 3:** Push the rock (r) if it blocks the path.
     - If the rock is in the way, push it down or right.
   - **Step 4:** Continue moving Baba up and right, avoiding obstacles.
     - Keep moving Baba towards the flag.
   - **Step 5:** Once Baba is adjacent to the flag, use the PUSH rule to move the flag to Baba.
     - Push the flag down or right to align it with Baba.

6. **Execution:**

   **Move Baba:**
   ```
   .b....f.
   _...r.._

     - **FLAG IS WIN:** The flag is the winning condition.

2. **Identify Objectives:**
   - **Objective:** Move Baba to the Flag to win.
   - **Obstacles:**
     - Rock (r) and Wall (w) are immovable.
     - Baba needs a path to the flag.

3. **Analyze Initial State:**
   - Baba starts at the bottom right corner.
   - The flag is at the top right corner.
   - There are rocks and walls blocking direct paths.

4. **Devising a Plan:**
   - **Step 1:** Move the rock (r) to create a path.
   - **Step 2:** Push the wall (w) to clear another path.
   - **Step 3:** Move Baba to the flag.

5. **Intermediate Actions:**
   - **Move the Rock (r):** 
     - First, we need to make the rock movable. 
     - We don't have "ROCK IS MOVE" initially, so we need to create it.
   - **Creating "ROCK IS MOVE":**
     - Move the "R" (rock) text block to align with "IS MOVE" text block.
     - Arrange: R IS MOVE.
   - **Move the Rock:**
     - Now, the rock can be moved.
     - Move the rock to the left to clear a path for Baba.
   - **Move the Wall (w):**
     - Align "W" (wall) with "IS PUSH" to make it pushable.
     - Arrange: W IS PUSH.
   - **Push the Wall:**
     - Push the wall down to clear another path.
   - **Move Baba to the Flag:**
     - With the paths cleared, move Baba to the flag.

6. **Execution:**
   - **Step 1:** Align "R" with "IS MOVE" to make the rock movable.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_B12..F13_
_........_
_........_
_.b....r._
_........_
_.R1R...._
_........_
_.....R1F_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, ROCK IS ROCK and ROCK IS FLAG.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

First, let's analyze the given grid and the active rules:

1. **Objects and Text Blocks:**
   - B = Baba (BABA)
   - . = Empty space
   - B = Baba (object)
   - F = Flag (object)
   - R = Rock (object)
   - 1 = IS
   - 2 = YOU
   - 3 = WIN
   - 12 = IS WIN (Flag is Win)
   - 13 = IS WIN (Flag is Win)
   - R = Rock (object)
   - R1 = ROCK IS ROCK (Rock is Rock)
   - R1R = ROCK IS FLAG (Rock is Flag)

2. **Active Rules:**
   - BABA IS YOU: Baba is the player-controlled object.
   - FLAG IS WIN: The Flag is the winning condition.
   - ROCK IS ROCK: This rule is redundant since it just confirms that Rock remains Rock.
   - ROCK IS FLAG: This rule changes Rocks into Flags.

**Objective:**
Reach the Flag (F) to win the level.

**Plan:**
1. **Utilize the ROCK IS FLAG rule:** Since Rocks can turn into Flags, we need to strategically move Rocks to create a path to the Flag.
2. **Move Baba (Baba) to manipulate Rocks:** Baba can push Rocks and potentially turn them into Flags.
3. **Ensure a clear path to the Flag:** Clear any obstacles that might block Baba's path to the Flag.

**Intermediate Actions:**

1. **Move Baba (Baba) to the right to push the initial Rock (R) down.**
2. **Utilize the ROCK IS FLAG rule to turn the pushed Rock into a Flag.**
3. **Move Baba to the newly created Flag to win the level.**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Move Baba (Baba) to the right:**
   ```
   _B..F13_
   _........_
   _........_
   _.b....r._
   _........_
   _.R1R...._
   _........_
   _.....R1F_
   ```
   Baba moves to the right.

2. **Push the Rock (R) down:**
   ```
   _B..F13_
   _........_
   _........_
   _.b...r._
   _........_
   _.R1R...._
   _........_
   _.....R1F_
   ```
   Baba pushes the Rock down.

3. **Utilize ROCK IS FLAG to turn the pushed Rock into a Flag:**
   ```
   _B..F13_
   _........_
   _........_
   _.b...F._
   _........_
   _.R1R...._
   _........_
   _.....R1F_
   ```
   The Rock transforms into a Flag.

4. **Move Baba to the Flag to win the level:**
   ```
   _B..F13_
   _........_
   _........_
   _.b...F._
   _........_
   _.R1R...._
   _........_
   _...B.F._
   ```
   Baba moves to the Flag.

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is to move Baba to the Flag, utilizing the ROCK IS FLAG rule to create a path to the Flag. The steps are:

1. Move Baba to the right.
2. Push the Rock down.
3. Transform the Rock into a Flag using ROCK IS FLAG.
4. Move Baba to the Flag to win.

Final Answer: Move Baba to the Flag. I hope it is correct.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and SKULL IS KILL.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Grid and Rules:**
   - **Active Rules:** 
     - BABA IS YOU: Baba is the player-controlled object.
     - FLAG IS WIN: The flag is the winning condition.
     - SKULL IS KILL: The skull kills Baba if they touch.
   - **Objects:**
     - B = Baba (Player)
     - S = Skull
     - F = Flag (Winning Object)
     - s = Floor
     - . = Empty Space
   - **Text Blocks:**
     - 1 = IS
     - 2 = YOU
     - 3 = WIN
     - 4 = KILL
     - 5 = PUSH
     - 6 = STOP
     - 7 = MOVE
     - 8 = HOT
     - 9 = MELT
     - 0 = SINK

2. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Baba starts at the bottom right corner.
   - The flag (F) is at the top left corner.
   - Skull (S) is positioned to block Baba's direct path to the flag.
   - Floors (s) are movable and can be used to create a path.

3. **Plan:**
   - Move floors to create a path from Baba to the flag.
   - Avoid touching the skull.

4. **Intermediate Actions:**
   - **Step 1:** Move the floor directly below Baba (s) to the right to create a path.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.
 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Grid and Rules:**
   - **Objects:** 
     - `B` = Baba (You)
     - `f` = Flag (Win)
     - `l` = Lava (Hot)
     - `B` = Baba (Melt)
     - `b` = Baba (Controlled by You)
     - `1` = IS
     - `2` = YOU
     - `3` = WIN
     - `4` = KILL
     - `5` = PUSH
     - `6` = STOP
     - `7` = MOVE
     - `8` = HOT
     - `9` = MELT
     - `0` = SINK
   - **Active Rules:**
     - `BABA IS YOU` (You control Baba)
     - `FLAG IS WIN` (Flag is the winning condition)
     - `LAVA IS HOT` (Lava melts Baba)
     - `BABA IS MELT` (Baba melts when it touches Lava)

2. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Baba starts at `B12`.
   - Flag is at `F13`.
   - Lava is at `l`.
   - Baba at `b1` is the one you control.

3. **Plan:**
   - Move the controlled Baba (`b`) to reach the Flag (`f`) without touching the Lava (`l`).
   - Use the `PUSH` rule to move obstacles if necessary.

4. **Intermediate Actions:**
   - **Step 1:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b2`.
   - **Step 2:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b3`.
   - **Step 3:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b4`.
   - **Step 4:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b5`.
   - **Step 5:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b6`.
   - **Step 6:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b7`.
   - **Step 7:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b8`.
   - **Step 8:** Move `b` (Baba) to `b9`.
   - **Step 9:** Move `b` (Baba) to `f` (Flag).

5. **Execution:**
   - **Move Baba (`b`) to `b2`**: 
     ```
     ________
     _...f...._
     _........_
     _llllllll_
     _L.....B._
     _1...b.1._
     _8.....9._
     _........_
     _B12..F13_
     ________
     ```
   - **Move Baba (`b`) to `b3`**:
     ```
     ________
     _...f...._
     _........_
     _llllllll_
     _L.....B._
     _1...b.1._
     _8.....9._
     _........_
     _B12..F13_
     ________
     ```
   - Continue moving Baba (`b`) through the grid until it reaches `f` (Flag).

6. **Final Move:**
   - **Move Baba (`b`) to `f`**:
     ```
     ________
     _...f...._
     _........_
     _llllllll_
     _L.....B._
     _1...b.f._
     _8.....9._
     _........_
     _B12..F13_
     ________
     ```
   - Baba reaches the Flag, winning the level.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,

<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

_........_

__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In this level, the objects are:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)

The text blocks are:
- B12 (BABA IS <property>)
- F13 (FLAG IS WIN)

The active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU (You control the BABA)
- FLAG IS WIN (The goal is to reach the FLAG)

The grid is a 9x9 grid, with walls (W) and empty spaces (.) surrounding the grid.

The goal is to move the BABA to the FLAG, which is located at position (5,8).

To solve this problem, we need to create rules that allow the BABA to move towards the FLAG.

First, let's make the BABA move towards the FLAG:
1. Move B12 to (5,8) and change it to B58 IS MOVE.
2. Move F13 to (5,8) and change it to F58 IS YOU.

Now, the BABA will move towards the FLAG. However, there are obstacles in the way. To remove the obstacles, we can use the following rules:

3. Move B12 to (5,7) and change it to B57 IS KILL.
4. Move F13 to (5,6) and change it to F56 IS PUSH.

Now, the BABA can move towards the FLAG, and it can destroy the obstacles in its path.

5. Move B58 to (5,6) and change it to B56 IS MOVE.
6. Move F56 to (5,7) and change it to F57 IS YOU.

Now, the BABA can move towards the FLAG, and it can destroy the obstacles in its path.

7. Move B56 to (5,8) and change it to B58 IS MOVE.
8. Move F57 to (5,8) and change it to F58 IS YOU.

Now, the BABA is at the position of the FLAG. To win the level, we need to make the FLAG IS WIN rule active again.

9. Move B58 to (5,7) and change it to B57 IS STOP.
10. Move F58 to (5,8) and change it to F58 IS WIN.

Now, the BABA is at the position of the FLAG, and the FLAG IS WIN rule is active. The level is solved.

The final active rules are:
- B57 IS STOP
- F58 IS WIN

The final grid is:
__________
_B57..F58_
_........_
_........_
_........_
_.b....f._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________

The BABA is at the position (5,7), and the FLAG is at the position (5,8). The BABA is stopped, and the FLAG is marked as WIN, so the level is solved.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In this level, we have the following objects:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)

We have the following text blocks:
- BABA IS YOU
- ... (empty space)
- 1, 2, 3, ... (numbers)
- F (flag)

The active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU: Makes the BABA object the one you control in the game.

The goal is to move the BABA object to the flag (F) to win the level.

Plan:
1. Move the BABA object to the flag (F)

Intermediate actions:
1. Move the BABA object to the position of the flag (F)

To move the BABA object to the flag (F), we need to change the rule so that the BABA object moves towards the flag (F). To do this, we can move the text blocks around to form a new rule.

First, we need to move the BABA object closer to the flag (F). We can do this by pushing the BABA object towards the flag (F) using the rule BABA IS PUSH.

Next, we need to change the rule so that the BABA object moves towards the flag (F). To do this, we can move the text blocks around to form a new rule. We can try moving the text blocks to form the rule: BABA IS MOVE F. This rule will make the BABA object move towards the flag (F) every turn.

After moving the text blocks to form the rule BABA IS MOVE F, the BABA object will move towards the flag (F) every turn. We can then wait for the BABA object to reach the flag (F) and win the level.

Answer:
1. Move the BABA object closer to the flag (F) using the rule BABA IS PUSH.
2. Move the text blocks to form the rule BABA IS MOVE F.
3. Wait for the BABA object to reach the flag (F) and win the level.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


In this level, we have the following objects:
- BABA (B)
- 1 (1)
- 2 (2)
- b (b)
- 3 (3)

The text blocks are:
- BABA IS YOU

The rules in this level are:
- BABA IS YOU: Makes the BABA object the player controlled object.

The goal of this level is to move the BABA object to the position of the object b (b).

To solve this level, we need to change the rule BABA IS YOU to b IS YOU. To do this, we need to move the text block 12 to the position of the text block BABA.

Intermediate actions:
1. Move the text block 12 to the position of the text block BABA.
2. Move the BABA object to the position of the object b (b).

The final solution is:
1. Move the text block 12 to the position of the text block BABA.
2. Move the BABA object to the position of the object b (b).

After performing these actions, the BABA object will be controlled by the player and will be moved to the position of the object b (b). The final active rule will be b IS YOU.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Objects:
- BABA (b)
- SKULL (s)
- FLAG (f)

Text Blocks:
- S14 (Skull with property 14)
- b (BABA)
- f (FLAG)

Rules:
- BABA IS YOU (You control BABA)
- FLAG IS WIN (To win, you need to reach the FLAG)
- SKULL IS KILL (Skulls destroy anything you control)

Plan:
1. Move the SKULL away from the BABA to avoid it destroying BABA.
2. Move the BABA to the FLAG to win the game.

Intermediate Actions:
1. Move the S14 block to a safe location where it won't interfere with the BABA.
2. Move the BABA to a location where it can reach the FLAG without being destroyed by the SKULL.
3. Move the BABA to the FLAG to win the game.

Solution:
1. Move S14 to a safe location, for example, the top-left corner (W11).
2. Move BABA to the bottom-left corner (A12) to avoid the SKULL.
3. Move BABA to the bottom-right corner (R13) to reach the FLAG.
4. Move BABA to the FLAG (F13) to win the game.

The final grid after solving the level:
__________
_........_
_........_
_S14......_
_.........._
_.b..sfs._
_.........._
_.........._
_B12..F13._
__________

The final active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, and SKULL IS KILL. The BABA has been moved to the FLAG, so the game is won.

Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_L16....._
_.....f.._
_llllllll_
_........_
_B....b.._
_1......._
_2..F13.._
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and LAVA IS STOP.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Objects:
- BABA (b)
- FLAG (f)
- LAVA (l)

Text Blocks:
- L16 (16)
- ... (.)
- f (f)
- l (l)
- lllllll (8l)
- B (b)
- b (b)
- 1 (1)
- 2 (2)
- F (f)
- 13 (13)

Rules:
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN
- LAVA IS STOP

Plan:
1. Move the BABA to the flag (f) to control it.
2. Move the BABA to the block with number 16 (L16) and change the rule to "16 IS MOVE" to make the number move towards the flag.
3. Move the BABA to the block with number 13 (F13) and change the rule to "13 IS KILL" to make the number destroy the flag when it reaches it.
4. Move the BABA to the block with number 1 (1) and change the rule to "1 IS PUSH" to make the number push the BABA towards the flag.
5. Move the BABA to the block with number 2 (2) and change the rule to "2 IS STOP" to make the number stop the BABA from moving past it.
6. Move the BABA to the block with the flag (f) and change the rule to "f IS YOU" to control the flag.
7. Move the flag to the block with number 13 (F13) and change the rule to "F13 IS WIN" to win the level.

Intermediate Actions:
1. Move the BABA to the block with the flag (f) and change the rule to "f IS YOU".
2. Move the BABA to the block with number 16 (L16) and change the rule to "16 IS MOVE".
3. Move the BABA to the block with number 1 (1) and change the rule to "1 IS PUSH".
4. Move the BABA to the block with number 2 (2) and change the rule to "2 IS STOP".
5. Move the BABA to the block with the flag (f) and change the rule to "f IS YOU" again (since we changed it earlier).
6. Move the flag to the block with number 13 (F13) and change the rule to "F13 IS WIN".
7. Move the flag to the exit point to win the level.

Answer:
The solution to the given level is to move the BABA to the flag (f), control the flag, move the flag to the block with number 13 (F13), change the rule to "F13 IS WIN", and move the flag to the exit point. The intermediate steps involve moving the BABA to the number blocks, changing the rules to make the number blocks push and move the flag, and stopping the BABA from moving past certain points.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem
- The grid level is a 9x9 grid with 10 objects and 10 text blocks.
- The current active rules are BABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN.
- The goal is to move the BABA object to the FLAG object.

Step 2: Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules
- Objects: BABA, FLOOR, FLAG, WALL, ROCK, and GRASS.
- Text blocks: BABA, IS, YOU, FLAG, IS, WIN.
- Rules: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN.

Step 3: Devise a plan
- We need to move the BABA object to the FLAG object.
- To do this, we need to change the rule BABA IS YOU to BABA IS MOVE.
- Then, we need to push the ROCK object to the WALL object to create a path for the BABA object to reach the FLAG object.

Step 4: Carry out the plan
- Move the IS text block to the right of the BABA text block to create the rule BABA IS MOVE.
- Push the ROCK object to the WALL object to create a path for the BABA object to reach the FLAG object.
- Move the BABA object to the FLAG object to win the level.

Answer:
- Move the IS text block to the right of the BABA text block to create the rule BABA IS MOVE.
- Push the ROCK object to the WALL object to create a path for the BABA object to reach the FLAG object.
- Move the BABA object to the FLAG object to win the level.

Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules.

Objects:
B = BABA
F = FLAG

Text Blocks:
BABA
IS
YOU
FLAG

Rules:
BABA IS YOU

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

1. Move the BABA IS YOU rule to the right of the BABA object.
2. Move the BABA object to the right of the FLAG object.
3. Move the IS text block to the right of the FLAG object.
4. Move the YOU text block to the right of the FLAG object.
5. Move the FLAG object to the empty space.
6. Move the IS text block to the right of the BABA object.
7. Move the YOU text block to the right of the BABA object.
8. Move the BABA object to the empty space.
9. Move the FLAG object to the empty space.
10. Move the IS text block to the right of the FLAG object.
11. Move the YOU text block to the right of the FLAG object.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and solve the problem step by step.

1. Move the BABA IS YOU rule to the right of the BABA object.
	* Move the IS text block to the right of the BABA object.
	* Move the YOU text block to the right of the BABA object.
	* Move the BABA object to the right of the FLAG object.
	* Move the FLAG object to the empty space.
2. Move the IS text block to the right of the FLAG object.
	* Move the YOU text block to the right of the FLAG object.
3. Move the FLAG object to the empty space.

The final state of the grid is:
__________
_B12...13_
_........_
_........_
_.....F.._
_.b....f._
_........_
_........_
_........_
__________

The final active rules are: FLAG IS YOU.

Now, the BABA object is controlled by the FLAG IS YOU rule, so the BABA object moves to the empty space and reaches the FLAG object, and the level is solved.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules.

The grid level is a 10x7 grid with 9 rows and 7 columns. The grid contains several objects and text blocks. The relevant objects are:
- BABA (represented by B)
- SKULL (represented by S)
- FLAG (represented by F)
- FLOOR (represented by O)
- GRASS (represented by A)
- LAVA (represented by L)
- ROCK (represented by R)
- WALL (represented by W)
- KEKE (represented by K)
- GOOP (represented by G)
- LOVE (represented by V)

The relevant text blocks are:
- IS (represented by 1)
- YOU (represented by 2)
- WIN (represented by 3)
- KILL (represented by 4)
- PUSH (represented by 5)
- STOP (represented by 6)
- MOVE (represented by 7)
- HOT (represented by 8)
- MELT (represented by 9)
- SINK (represented by 0)

The current active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to reach the FLAG object. To do this, we need to change the rules so that we can control the FLAG object and move it to the empty space next to the WALL object.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

1. Move the IS text block to the right of the BABA text block to create the rule BABA IS.
2. Move the YOU text block to the right of the IS text block to create the rule BABA IS YOU.
3. Move the FLAG text block to the right of the BABA IS YOU rule to create the rule FLAG IS YOU.
4. Move the FLAG object to the empty space next to the WALL object.
5. Move the IS text block to the right of the FLAG text block to create the rule FLAG IS.
6. Move the WIN text block to the right of the IS text block to create the rule FLAG IS WIN.

Step 4: Show the answer.

The final grid level should look like this:
__________
_........_
_...B12.._
_........_
_.1......_
_.3..b..._
_........_
_...F..._
_........_
__________

The current active rules are: FLAG IS WIN.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem
- The grid level is given with the current active rules.
- The goal is to move the flag to the bottom right corner.

Step 2: Extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules
- Objects: BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, ROCK, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE, and empty space.
- Text blocks: BABA, IS, YOU, FLAG, IS, WIN.
- Rules: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN.

Step 3: Devise a plan
- Make BABA the object you control.
- Make FLAG the object you need to reach to win the level.
- Make sure BABA can move through the grass and the rock.
- Make sure BABA can push the rock.
- Make sure the rock can't destroy BABA.
- Make sure the rock can't destroy the flag.
- Make sure the flag can't destroy BABA.
- Make sure the flag can't destroy the rock.
- Make sure the rock can't move.
- Make sure the flag can't move.

Step 4: Carry out the plan
- Move the IS YOU text block to the BABA text block to make BABA the object you control.
- Move the IS WIN text block to the FLAG text block to make the FLAG the object you need to reach to win the level.
- Move the IS PUSH text block to the GRASS text block to make BABA able to move through the grass.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules.

The relevant objects in the level are:
- BABA
- SKULL
- FLAG
- FLOOR
- GRASS
- WALL
- KEKE
- GOOP
- LOVE

The relevant text blocks in the level are:
- KEKE
- FLAG
- 1
- 2
- 7
- 13
- b
- f

The current active rules are:
- KEKE IS MOVE
- FLAG IS WIN

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the level, we need to reach the FLAG. However, the FLAG is currently blocked by the KEKE. We need to change the rules so that we can move the KEKE out of the way.

Step 3: Carry out the plan.

First, we need to move the 1 text block to the right of the KEKE. This will make the KEKE inmutable, so it won't move on its own.

Next, we need to move the 2 text block to the right of the BABA. This will make the BABA the object we control.

Now, we can move the BABA to the right and push the KEKE out of the way.

Finally, we can move the BABA to the FLAG to win the level.

Step 4: Show the answer.

The solution to the level is:

1. Move the 1 text block to the right of the KEKE.
2. Move the 2 text block to the right of the BABA.
3. Move the BABA to the right and push the KEKE out of the way.
4. Move the BABA to the FLAG to win the level.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem

The grid level is a 9x9 grid with 16 non-empty cells. The grid contains 3 text blocks: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, and WALL IS STOP. The grid also contains 3 objects: BABA, FLAG, and WALL. The BABA object is in the bottom left corner of the grid, the FLAG object is in the top right corner of the grid, and the WALL objects are in the top and bottom rows of the grid.

Step 2: Extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules

The relevant objects are BABA, FLAG, and WALL. The relevant text blocks are BABA, FLAG, and WALL. The relevant rules are BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN, and WALL IS STOP.

Step 3: Devise a plan

The goal is to move the BABA object to the FLAG object. To do this, we need to change the rules so that the BABA object can move through the WALL objects. We can do this by changing the WALL IS STOP rule to WALL IS YOU. This will make the WALL objects controllable and allow us to move them out of the way.

Step 4: Carry out the plan

1. Move the BABA object to the left until it is in the same row as the WALL objects.
2. Change the WALL IS STOP rule to WALL IS YOU by pushing the WALL text block to the left of the IS text block.
3. Move the WALL objects out of the way by pushing them up or down.
4. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object.

Step 5: Show the answer

The answer is:

1. Move the BABA object to the left until it is in the same row as the WALL objects.
2. Change the WALL IS STOP rule to WALL IS YOU by pushing the WALL text block to the left of the IS text block.
3. Move the WALL objects out of the way by pushing them up or down.
4. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object.

The solution is:

1. Move the BABA object to the left until it is in the same row as the WALL objects.
2. Change the WALL IS STOP rule to WALL IS YOU by pushing the WALL text block to the left of the IS text block.
3. Move the WALL objects out of the way by pushing them up or down.
4. Move the BABA object to the right until it reaches the FLAG object.

The final state of the grid is:

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules.

The grid level is a 9x9 grid with a border of underscores. The relevant objects in the grid are:
- BABA (represented by B)
- SKULL (represented by S)
- FLAG (represented by F)
- FLOOR (represented by O)
- GRASS (represented by A)
- LAVA (represented by L)
- ROCK (represented by R)
- WALL (represented by W)
- KEKE (represented by K)
- GOOP (represented by G)
- LOVE (represented by V)

The relevant text blocks in the grid are:
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN
- SKULL IS KILL

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

The goal is to move the BABA object to the FLAG object. However, there are SKULL objects that are KILL objects, which will destroy the BABA object if it touches them. To solve the problem, we need to change the rules so that the BABA object can safely reach the FLAG object.

One possible solution is to change the SKULL IS KILL rule to a different rule that does not destroy the BABA object. For example, we could change the rule to SKULL IS PUSH, which would allow the BABA object to push the SKULL object out of the way.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

To change the SKULL IS KILL rule to SKULL IS PUSH, we need to move the text blocks around so that they form a valid rule. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Move the "PUSH" text block so that it is aligned horizontally with the "SKULL" text block. This forms the rule SKULL IS PUSH.
2. Move the "KILL" text block so that it is no longer aligned with the "SKULL" text block. This effectively removes the KILL property from the SKULL object.

Now that we have changed the SKULL IS KILL rule to SKULL IS PUSH, the BABA object can safely reach the FLAG object by pushing the SKULL objects out of the way. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Move the BABA object so that it is aligned horizontally with the SKULL object.
2. Use the BABA object to push the SKULL object to the right.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the BABA object reaches the FLAG object.

Step 4: Show the answer.

The answer is:

1. Move the "PUSH" text block so that it is aligned horizontally with the "SKULL" text block.
2. Move the "KILL" text block so that it is no longer aligned with the "SKULL" text block.
3. Move the BABA object so that it is aligned horizontally with the SKULL object.
4. Use the BABA object to push the SKULL object to the right.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the BABA object reaches the FLAG object.

The BABA object will now be able to safely reach the FLAG object and the level will be solved.

current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and GOOP IS SINK.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


Step 1: Understand the problem and extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules.

The relevant objects in the level are:
- BABA
- FLAG
- GOOP
- FLOOR
- WALL
- ROCK

The relevant text blocks in the level are:
- BABA
- FLAG
- GOOP
- FLOOR
- WALL
- ROCK
- IS
- YOU
- WIN
- SINK

The current active rules are:
- BABA IS YOU
- FLAG IS WIN
- GOOP IS SINK

Step 2: Devise a plan to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to reach the FLAG. However, the FLAG is currently surrounded by GOOP, which will destroy anything it touches. To solve this, we need to change the GOOP IS SINK rule to something else. We can do this by moving the GOOP text block to a new location and forming a new rule.

Step 3: Carry out the plan and give intermediate actions.

1. Move the BABA text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
2. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the BABA text block.
3. Move the GOOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
4. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
5. Move the FLOOR text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
6. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the FLOOR text block.
7. Move the YOU text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
8. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the YOU text block.
9. Move the GOOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
10. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
11. Move the STOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.

Step 4: Solve the problem step by step and show the answer.

1. Move the BABA text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
2. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the BABA text block.
3. Move the GOOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
4. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
5. Move the FLOOR text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
6. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the FLOOR text block.
7. Move the YOU text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
8. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the YOU text block.
9. Move the GOOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
10. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
11. Move the STOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.

Now, the GOOP is not SINK anymore, so it won't destroy anything it touches. We can now move the BABA to the FLAG and win the level.

Final answer:

1. Move the BABA text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
2. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the BABA text block.
3. Move the GOOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
4. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
5. Move the FLOOR text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
6. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the FLOOR text block.
7. Move the YOU text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
8. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the YOU text block.
9. Move the GOOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
10. Move the IS text block to the empty space below the GOOP text block.
11. Move the STOP text block to the empty space below the IS text block.
12. Move the BABA object to the FLAG object to win the level.

<|endoftext|><|user|> You are helping to solve a gridworld game. In Baba Is You, the player can change the game rules by moving text blocks around. The grid contains object text and property text.

Text Blocks:
Object Text: Words representing game objects.
Property Text: Words that describe actions or properties.

Active Rules:
A rule is formed when the text blocks are aligned in a valid way, either horizontally or vertically. Valid rule formats include:
<object_text> IS <property_text>: Grants a property to an object. 
<object1_text> IS <object2_text>: Changes one object into another. 
<object1_text> IS <object1_text>: Makes an object inmutable.
The goal is to use these rules to solve the level by moving the text blocks and controlling the objects.

The level is displayed in a 2D grid, where each character has the following meaning:
Text blocks in the game which always can be pushed:
<object_text>:
    B = BABA,
    S = SKULL,
    F = FLAG,
    O = FLOOR,
    A = GRASS,
    L = LAVA,
    R = ROCK,
    W = WALL,
    K = KEKE,
    G = GOOP,
    V = LOVE

<property_text>:
    1 = IS
    2 = YOU,
    3 = WIN,
    4 = KILL,
    5 = PUSH,
    6 = STOP,
    7 = MOVE,
    8 = HOT,
    9 = MELT,
    0 = SINK

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.

Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


First, let's extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules from the given level:

Objects:
B = BABA
F = FLAG
G = GOOP
R = ROCK

Text Blocks:
BABA IS YOU
FLAG IS WIN
GOOP IS SINK
ROCK IS PUSH

Rules:
BABA IS YOU: The player controls the BABA object.
FLAG IS WIN: The goal is to reach the FLAG object.
GOOP IS SINK: The GOOP object destroys itself and anything it touches when it is touched.
ROCK IS PUSH: The player can push the ROCK object.

Now, let's devise a plan to solve the problem:

1. Move the BABA object to the ROCK object.
2. Push the ROCK object onto the GOOP object to destroy it.
3. Move the BABA object to the FLAG object to win the level.

Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


First, let's extract the relevant objects, text blocks, and rules from the given level:

Objects:
BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE

Text Blocks:
Object Text: BABA, SKULL, FLAG, FLOOR, GRASS, WALL, KEKE, GOOP, LOVE
Property Text: IS, YOU, WIN, KILL, PUSH, STOP, MELT, HOT, MOVE

Active Rules:
BABA IS YOU
FLAG IS WIN
WALL IS STOP

Now, let's devise a plan to solve the problem:

1. Make BABA the object you control by aligning the text blocks "BABA IS YOU".
2. Move BABA to the FLAG by pushing the GRASS blocks out of the way.
3. Make the FLAG the object you control by aligning the text blocks "FLAG IS YOU".
4. Move the FLAG to the WALL with the number 13 on it.
5. Align the text blocks "WALL IS WIN" to make the WALL the winning condition.
6. Move the FLAG to the WALL with the number 13 on it to win the level.

Now, let's carry out the plan step by step:

1. Move the text blocks "BABA IS YOU" to align them horizontally.
2. Move BABA to the FLAG by pushing the GRASS blocks out of the way.
3. Move the text blocks "FLAG IS YOU" to align them horizontally.
4. Move the FLAG to the WALL with the number 13 on it.
5. Move the text blocks "WALL IS WIN" to align them horizontally.
6. Move the FLAG to the WALL with the number 13 on it to win the level.

Answer:

1. BABA IS YOU
2. Move BABA to the FLAG
3. FLAG IS YOU
4. Move the FLAG to the WALL with the number 13 on it
5. WALL IS WIN
6. Move the FLAG to the WALL with the number 13 on it to win the level.

objects in the game:
<object>:
    b = object baba,
    s = object skull,
    f = object flag,
    o = object floor,
    a = object grass,
    l = object lava,
    r = object rock,
    w = object wall,
    k = object keke,
    g = object goop,
    v = object love,
    _ = border,
    . = empty space
    
<object_text> IS YOU: Makes the object you control in the game. You can move it and push blocks.
<object_text> IS WIN: The object you need to reach or to be to win the level.
<object_text> IS STOP: Makes the object impassable (you can't move through it).
<object_text> IS MELT: Makes the object melt when touched by something marked as HOT.
<object_text> IS HOT: Makes the object destroy any object marked as MELT when they touch it. If the same object is both HOT and MELT it self-destructs.
<object_text> IS MOVE: Makes the object move one step in its direction every turn.
<object_text> IS KILL: Makes the object destroy anything you control when touched, but it stays intact.
<object_text> IS PUSH: Lets you push the object or have it pushed by other moving objects.
<object_text> IS SINK: Makes the object destroy itself and anything it touches when it is touched.
Question: Give a solution for the following grid level:
__________
_L16....._
_.....f.._
_llllllll_
_........_
_B....b.._
_1......._
_2..F13.._
_........_
__________
current active rules are: BABA IS YOU, FLAG IS WIN and LAVA IS STOP.
Let’s first understand the problem extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules (explain the rules) in the given level and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let’s carry out the plan give the intermidiate actions (pay attention to common sense). Solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.


First, let's extract the relevant objects, text blocks and rules in the given level:

Objects:
BABA, LAVA, FLAG, FLOOR, GOOP, WALL

Text Blocks:
BABA, LAVA, FLAG, FLOOR, GOOP, WALL, IS, YOU, WIN, STOP

Rules:
BABA IS YOU
FLAG IS WIN
LAVA IS STOP

Now, let's devise a plan to solve the problem:

1. Change the rule "LAVA IS STOP" to "LAVA IS HOT" so that we can melt the goop and move through it.
2. Change the rule "BABA IS YOU" to "BABA IS MOVE" so that BABA moves automatically and we don't have to manually move it every turn.
3. Change the rule "BABA IS YOU" to "GOOP IS YOU" so that we can control the goop and use it to melt the lava.
4. Move the goop to the lava and melt it.
5. Move the BABA to the flag and win the level.

Now, let's carry out the plan and give the intermediate actions:

1. Change the rule "LAVA IS STOP" to "LAVA IS HOT":
  - Push the "HOT" block to the right of the "LAVA" block to form the rule "LAVA IS HOT".
2. Change the rule "BABA IS YOU" to "BABA IS MOVE":
  - Push the "MOVE" block to the right of the "BABA" block to form the rule "BABA IS MOVE".
3. Change the rule "BABA IS YOU" to "GOOP IS YOU":
  - Push the "GOOP" block to the right of the "BABA" block to form the rule "BABA IS GOOP".
  - Push the "YOU" block to the right of the "GOOP" block to form the rule "GOOP IS YOU".
4. Move the goop to the lava and melt it:
  - Move the goop to the left and down to the lava.
  - Wait for the goop to melt the lava.
5. Move the BABA to the flag and win the level:
  - Move the BABA to the right and up to the flag.

The answer is:

1. Push the "HOT" block to the right of the "LAVA" block to form the rule "LAVA IS HOT".
2. Push the "MOVE" block to the right of the "BABA" block to form the rule "BABA IS MOVE".
3. Push the "GOOP" block to the right of the "BABA" block to form the rule "BABA IS GOOP".
4. Push the "YOU" block to the right of the "GOOP" block to form the rule "GOOP IS YOU".
5. Move the goop to the left and down to the lava.
6. Wait for the goop to melt the lava.
7. Move the BABA to the right and up to the flag.
